        In the mirror's gentle gaze, <br />
        I search for answers to life's maze. <br />
        A reflection stares, a soul so bright, <br />
        A question echoes, "Who am I in love's light?" <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        Do I see a heart that's pure and true, <br />
        Or a soul that's searching, still anew? <br />
        Do I see a love that's strong and free, <br />
        Or a heart that's broken, yet still yearning to be? <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        In the mirror's reflection, I see, <br />
        A love that's evolving, wild and carefree. <br />
        A love that's learning, growing every day, <br />
        A love that's embracing, come what may. <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        So I'll gaze into the mirror's eyes, <br />
        And ask again, "Who am I in love's surprise?" <br />
        And the reflection will smile and say, <br />
      </p>,
      <p>"You are loved, in every way."</p>,

        Why am I lost in the haze of my own identity? <br />
        What's driving this emptiness within? I gaze into the mirror, and the
        person staring back is a stranger.
      </p>,
      <p>
        My reflection's eyes are sunken, exhausted, and lifeless. I whisper
        apologies to the glass, 'I'm sorry I hurt you,' and 'I'm sorry I hate
        you.' The words spill out, though I'm unsure why I'm apologizing or why
        this self-loathing lingers.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Everyone around me seems to have a notion of who I am, but the truth is,
        I'm a mystery to myself. It's ironic, isn't it? I'm searching for
        answers in the eyes of a stranger – my own.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Mirror, mirror, I beg of you, tell me, who am I? Why do you remain
        silent? Your stillness is deafening. I yearn to understand, to connect
        with the person trapped behind this glass. Please, I need to know...I
        need to find myself.

        Mirror, mirror, who am I? <br />
        A wandering echo, a nameless sigh, <br />
        Like autumn leaves in a restless flight, <br />
        Or a candle dancing in borrowed light. <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        The silver glass hums soft and low, <br />
        A voice I knew so long ago. <br />
        It whispers truths I dare not face, <br />
        Of fleeting time and lost embrace. <br />

        Silent storms softly scream within, <br />
        Waves that pull but never end. <br />
        My laughter rings, yet sounds untrue, <br />
        Like hollow bells in morning dew. <br />

      <p>
        I have cried a river, deep and wide, <br />
        Yet fire and frost live side by side. <br />
        My heart, a war of dark and bright, <br />
        A caged bird dreaming of the night. <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        The past still lingers in the haze, <br />
        A withered rose, a lover’s gaze. <br />

      <p>
        Footsteps fade but never leave, <br />
        Like ghosts that hum beneath my sleeve.

      <p>
        The glass holds secrets I once knew, <br />
        A child who danced in skies so blue. <br />
        But now I stand, a fleeting spark, <br />
        A shadow lost between the dark. <br />

        All hands on deck, the voices call, <br />

        A girl who smiles but barely glows, <br />
        Who hides the weight of what she knows. <br />

        The doubt that bends me to its will. <br />

        There’s a voice that pulls me under, <br />
        It twists my thoughts, it calls me names. <br />
        Unworthy, unwanted, unseen, unloved— <br />
        It plays its cruel, relentless games. <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        I don’t want to be a burden, <br />
        Don’t want to beg, don’t want to plead. <br />
        But every time I reach for comfort, <br />
        I fear they’ll tire, they’ll leave, they’ll leave. <br />

        No one loves a heavy heart. <br />

        Swallow me whole and call it fate? <br />

        Simply existing from day to day, doing their best to keep the bad vibes

        Buried under a pile of insecurities, chained down by my own lack of
        self-belief, <br />
        Looking at me distraught at who we turned out to be, staring back at me

        Mirror mirror on the wall, I don’t know who I am anymore, <br />
        As I gaze in your world and stare at myself, I don’t recognise the
        person that stares back at me, <br />
        As I look into my eyes that hold no emotion, I see a soul, a soul that’s
        been broken, <br />
        Discarded and abandoned, beaten and bruised, left for dead at an early
        age, gone too soon, <br />
        Abandoned with their hopes and dreams, aspirations and self-belief,{" "}

        What has life got in store for me, nothing but atrocities, <br />
        From one curveball to the next, trials upon trials with no rest, <br />
        I’m ashamed to say that they got me down and I can’t muster the strength
        to get up one more time, <br />
        So I lay there wallowing in self-pity, sometimes I cry, but most times I
        mourn, <br />
        At the death of the person who I was supposed to be, buried under a pile

        Do you see someone at the verge of having it all or someone forever
        destined to be in a rut, <br />
        Do you still see hope in my eyes, or has my despair rendered you blind,{" "}

        I don’t want the tough times or atrocities, I just want good, is that
        too much for me? <br />
        I’m tired of living like I was born to fight, fighting for my life every
        day I’m alive, <br />
        I just want to live, happy and free, free from all of my misery, <br />
        So I can finally stop my self-loathing and learn what it feels like to
        love me.

      <h3>Mirror Mirror on the wall</h3>,
      <p>
        The very on that hid my small scars and tainted my flaws, painting them
        as flowers so beautiful and perfect to the outside world but through
        you, I could see me.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I would trace my fingers along the contours of my face and trace out the
        marks along my thighs and hold my belly folds between my fingers but you
        showed my face to me as another reason to live.
      </p>,
      <p>
        They said my smile was beautiful but you showed them off to me without
        telling. The sides of my body that was hidden to me, I saw through you.
        Through that mirror on the wall, I saw my eyes with my eyes— those dark
        brown orbs and those lashes that flutter with every blink — and in those
        eyes, I saw life and light shone through them.
      </p>,
      <p>
        But I don't see me through you anymore. Every single time I look into
        the mirror, I see that little girl who loved the mirror and made it her
        life. I see her walking to the front of the mirror with tears in her
        eyes because somehow, only her reflection might be able to understand
        her and through that mirror, she might find herself again.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I see her this time with a smile on her face— maybe with happiness and
        pride or it could be her default mode like a Chinese doll— aching to
        give me a hug. I see the pride in her eyes and I could swear that I'd
        never seen it there before.
      </p>,
      <p>
        My little self met with me yesterday at the mirror and she had a lot to
        say about me but there was something about her smile and I could tell
        that it came from deep within.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Her smile served as a means of rest to my troubled soul and rest in the
        midst of my turbulence and I whispered to her through the mirror, “Love
        yourself, my darling. There's no one else who could love you more on
        earth.”

        I have walked through shadows, silent and deep, <br />

        For every flaw , a whispered doubt, <br />A voice inside that shut me
        out.

      <p>
        I spent years as a stranger to myself, <br />
        Tracing every flaw like map to shame . <br />
        A whispered voice, never kind , never still, <br />
        Telling me I was never enough.

      <p>
        The world had taught me to compare , <br />
        To shrink , to change , to not be rare. <br />

        Each imperfection , still a sign.

      <p>
        I shrank myself to fit their mold , <br />
        Muted my laughter , softened my fire, <br />
        Called my passions “too much” , my hobbies “childish”, <br />
        Until I became a ghost of my own desire.
      </p>,
      <p>
        But somewhere between the nights and days, <br />
        I found the strength to change my ways . <br />
        Not in perfection ,nor grace , <br />
        But in the light behind my face.
      </p>,
      <p>
        My flaws? They are my battles scars , <br />
        Proof that I have reached the stars . <br />
        My insecurities ? just fleeting mist , <br />
        Vanishing when love insists.
      </p>,
      <p>
        My passions set my soul aflame , <br />
        They are the whispers of my name. <br />
        My hobbies , simple yet profound , <br />
        Remind me where my joy is found.
      </p>,
      <p>
        So now I see a beauty built to last. <br />
        Not perfect , no, but whole , complete. <br />A heart that loves , a
        soul set free.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Now I stand before the mirror , unafraid, <br />
        And I see a masterpiece in every imperfection . <br />
        Not a single crack to hide in shame <br />
        Only beauty , only me, only love.

        For years,I avoided mirrors not just the glass ones but the reflection I
        saw in my mind. It took time , pain and self discovery to finally see
        myself with love and not judgement
      </p>,
      <p>
        The mirror felt like a cruel judge reflecting everything I wished I
        could change .Each time I look was a reminder of the ways I felt I
        didn't measure up .I would avoid my own reflection ,hoping if I didn't
        look I'll feel much better .But this didn't stop the voice in my head
        the one who told me I wasn't enough.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I hated the fact that my parent weren't together like a part of my life
        was incomplete. On top that I struggled with my body,my appearance in a
        society where beauty is measured by how curvy you look
      </p>,
      <p>
        It seemed like everyone had something I didn't and I wanted so badly to
        be accepted to fit in. But no matter how I tried ,I still felt like I
        was standing outside looking in. What I didn't realize then was that the
        acceptance I craved then had to start from within
      </p>,
      <p>
        I visited the market for the first time and watched how hard people
        worked just to survive. It made me think while I was consumed by my
        imperfections and insecurities there were people out there fighting
        everyday just to keep going ,people out there who just wanted little of
        the things I have. This made me appreciate the people who love me
        instead of worrying about who didn't accept me .I realized love was
        around me I just didn't see it

        Learning to love myself wasn't easy but it was worth it .I stopped
        searching for acceptance in people it made me realize that my worth
        isn't was never defined by my appearance or who was in my life .The
        mirror no longer feel like an enemy because now when I look at my
        reflection, I see someone who is enough

      <p>
        The day doesn’t get better when you are expected to be confident,
        fearless, and unshakable, but here I was, trembling at the feet of my
        reflection, wondering who the stranger before me was. How can I be those
        things expected of me if I can’t recognize who is staring back at me?
        Moments like this withdrew me from the blueprint made by society on how
        ‘being presentable’ should be, and I was far from it. The mirror doesn’t
        lie, but it doesn’t comfort me either. Everything I thought I was, was
        shown to me, including everything I was supposed to be. And there I was,
        trying to put the pieces together, from who I was to who the world told
        me I should be.
      </p>,
      <p>
        It began from my face, like a written story filled with crooked edges
        and quiet battles, written in every line and curve—the first thing
        people see and the last thing I want them to notice. I was never built
        with a perfect smile like the perfectly aligned ones in toothpaste
        commercials. Smiling back at the mirror reminded me of the constant
        teases and nasty comments I got from childhood. My hairline was another
        comma to my sentence. It seemed to be taking a slow moonwalk away from
        my forehead. I wasn’t in my thirties, and it was one of my struggles.
        Each flaw mentioned felt like I was losing a part of myself. My face
        didn’t measure up to what I wanted. It wasn’t ugly, but it wasn’t
        enough.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Then, there was the physical frame of what made me up. Would I say I was
        thin? Somehow, I was not lepa enough according to some and not orobo
        enough to others. I never looked malnourished or underweight, but I did
        not have a body that turned heads or commanded respect. I never want to
        be overweight, but I don’t want to feel invisible too. There were no
        better words to describe this feeling. It was like my mind had a
        distorted lens. No matter what I saw, it never looked right. Maybe I was
        trapped in a body that didn’t belong to me, and I was finding it hard to
        make peace with it.
      </p>,
      <p>
        If my face didn’t seem right and my body and mind disagreed, confidence
        would never find its way to me. Trying to stand out in public was like
        adding one plus one to get three. Impossible. I was too busy trying to
        blend in, seeking validation on who would accept my introverted self. I
        was too careful, and my movements were always calculated just because I
        was trying to avoid hearsay. I needed to be bold. I needed to be
        unapologetically me, but how can that happen when I don’t know who ‘me’
        is?
      </p>,
      <p>
        Maybe I was too full of hate to accept myself for who I was. Despite my
        imperfections, no one would welcome me with open arms without having one
        thing to say except me. I want to look back at this mirror and see
        someone who was trying and real. Maybe I don’t have to be perfect or
        fearless. Or maybe I don’t have to be bold and brave. But one thing I’d
        remind myself was that the stranger looking back at me was indeed me.
        And I was ready to make peace with him.

        how ugly and damaged I was whenever I looked into it.
      </p>,
      <p>
        It used to reveal the wounds I had been covering for years. The ones I
        almost forgot until one day I saw myself naked in the mirror; then every
        wound was revealed that where I had been touched before. I didn't have
        the strength to go through that pain again. That night, I felt as if
        everything had happened to me again. That’s when I decided to throw away
        my mirror as well as my unpleasant memories.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Because now I want to be clean, I want to wash myself until I erase
        those invisible scars I have on my body. I don't want to live with this
        fear anymore, because I’m not someone who should have bad memories and I
        believe that no one should have. Why should we live in the past that
        happened when we had weaker arms to push away and when we didn't know
        enough words to explain what happened to us. I think we should forget
        because we're not that anymore; now we have the power to pierce a body
        with our words. <br />
        We are capable of doing all the things we couldn't do to stop that from
        happening.
      </p>,
      <p>
        And I hope we can bring a mirror back into our home without fear.
        Because after all, we want to see how beautiful we look when loved
        nicely, without any stinky memories.

        I see a girl faint and covered in shadows <br />
        Too afraid to step into the clear light
      </p>,
      <p>
        I gaze deeper, and the glass reveals <br />
        A woman shrouded in insecurities <br />
        Crippled by her imaginative fear and anxiety
      </p>,
      <p>
        Her eyes, once bright, now dim and worn <br />
        Reflect the weight of a thousand unseen scars <br />
        The whispers of self-doubt, a relentless hum <br />A chorus of "not
        enough" that echoes and mars
      </p>,
      <p>
        Her skin, a canvas of imperfections <br />
        A topography of flaws, real and imagined <br />
        Each blemish, a reminder of her perceived shortcomings <br />A roadmap
        of self-criticism, etched and engraved
      </p>,
      <p>
        She searches for solace, a respite from the pain <br />
        A fleeting escape from the mirror's candid gaze <br />
        But like a specter, her reflection haunts her still <br />A constant
        reminder of her deepest fears and unfulfilled will
      </p>,
      <p>
        In the mirror's silvered light, she sees <br />
        A fragile, fragmented soul, lost and on her knees <br />
        A woman, wounded by the words of others <br />A heart, heavy with the
        weight of unshed tears
      </p>,
      <p>
        She yearns to break free from the shackles of her mind <br />
        To shatter the glass that holds her captive, left behind <br />
        To step into the light, unafraid and unashamed <br />
        To claim her worth, to own her beauty, to proclaim
      </p>,
      <p>
        But the mirror's gaze is unforgiving, a harsh critique <br />
        A reflection of her deepest insecurities, a relentless shriek <br />
        It whispers "you are not enough" in the dead of night <br />A cruel
        taunt, a heartless jest, a devastating blight
      </p>,
      <p>
        And so she hides, afraid to face the light <br />
        Afraid to confront the shadows that haunt her sight <br />
        Afraid to acknowledge the beauty that lies within <br />
        Afraid to love herself, to let go, to begin
      </p>,
      <p>
        But still, the mirror calls, a siren's song <br />
        A beckoning to confront, to heal, to move along <br />
        A reminder that the only way to break the chains <br />
        Is to face the fears, to heal the wounds, to ease the pains
      </p>,
      <p>
        And so she takes a breath, a tentative step forward <br />A fragile
        dance towards self-love, self-acceptance, and self-forgiveness <br />
        The mirror's gaze, still harsh, still unforgiving <br />
        But she stands tall, unwavering, her heart slowly beginning
      </p>,
      <p>
        To heal, to mend, to find its voice <br />
        To whisper "I am enough" in the silence of her choice <br />
        To shatter the glass, to break the chains <br />
        To emerge, reborn, renewed, with heart and soul regained.

      <p>
        SHE looks into the mirror on an unusual day because she rarely does look
        into the mirror. <br />
        She puts up a smile and leaves and it feels like she loves what she
        sees.
      </p>,
      <p>
        However, in truth, she would rather shatter the mirror and discard it
        for good. There is a reason why the mirror is her unliving enemy, a
        reason why she leaves the house without looking at it, a reason why she
        avoids it like a plague.
      </p>,
      <p>A reason only she knows...</p>,
      <p>
        The reason, actually is simple to some extent. The reason being that
        everything she has been avoiding to see, everything she has been
        avoiding to point out, everything she is afraid to discover is laid
        bare.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Her flaws, her imperfections, her hair sticking out, her face not as
        perfect as she wants it to be. She needs to lose a little bit of weight,
        no, maybe a lot of weight. She needs to not stand out so she
        underdresses, she needs things to help...to mold her into something she
        wants. And she stares, and stares and unconsciously begin to dislike
        everything. At the end of the day, her mood and happiness has been
        disrupted and she leaves sadly.
      </p>,
      <p>
        However, some random days. It's actually better. She looks into the
        mirror and likes what she sees. She believes that she might not be the
        most perfect person but she's fine just the way she is, and then she is
        glad. She is happy that maybe the other feelings the other day was just
        her being sad, being too beside herself. She is happy that she's happy
        being in her own skin. She is happy that she appreciates her skin. And
        then she leaves with a wide smile.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Then, some days. Some rather ugly days. Everything crashes and burns.
        The earlier appreciation and happiness has been turned from a sword in
        her hand protecting her from the pain to a sword aimed to her heart.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Insecurities? No, she would rather not call it insecurities, she would
        call them truth. Because to her, the mirror doesn't hide anything. It
        shows exactly what you are. And that makes it worse. Whenever she
        believes she's getting better, it comes to her again. She is angry at
        the mirror, wondering how and why it hurts her so much .
      </p>,
      <p>
        She loved herself the day before, she was happy and smiling the day
        before, she was staring at this same mirror and she was content. But now
        it doesn't seem so.
      </p>,
      <p>
        It's worse than the other feelings, this is ugly. This is frustrating.
        This is pain. And she hates everything all over again. She wants to
        change but she knows she can't. And heaven knows she's never going under
        a knife.
      </p>,
      <p>
        And so, she carries her ugly self and goes about her other days. She now
        knows the truth and she seemed to live with it. She doesn't care about
        looking at the mirror, what for? To see something ugly again?
      </p>,
      <p>
        The temptation sometimes will come, just a sneak peek she'll promise.
        Just a glimpse. But an inner voice will tell her not to because she
        knows how it'll end.
      </p>,
      <p>
        And so what? Even if she finds out that she's not so ugly after all,
        would that happiness last? Would the feeling stay with her? What's the
        point?
      </p>,
      <p>
        It goes on and on and on and on, until one day. Coincidentally and
        incidentally after avoiding, refusing, ignoring, passing by the mirror,
        she gets to look at herself in the mirror and...
      </p>,
      <p>Again. She feels not so bad.</p>,
      <p>
        She's not ugly but she's not the best, she's just...not bad. And that
        seemed to give her a little bit of hope. And so she wonders...who she
        is.
      </p>,
      <p>'who am I?' she ponders.</p>,
      <p>
        The truth is...she doesn't know. She is still trying to figure it out.
      </p>,
      <p>
        My, she loves herself, she does. But she also knows she criticizes
        herself. She is content with herself but she knows she can be better.
        She can be bold, and also shy. She can be loud and also quiet. She wants
        love but won't ask for it. She wants care but she won't force it. She
        wants to be held again in her mom's arms but she doesn't want to feel
        like a baby. She can be so friendly and also so unattached. She can be
        so nice and she can also be so snobbish. She is happy when she's happy
        with herself and she is sad when she is sad with herself. She tends to
        have difficulty letting things go but she can also walk away as if it
        was never hers. She doesn't really care but in truth sh really does. She
        wants to tell someone but she'd rather not.
      </p>,
      <p>
        She is a mixture of contradicting things which makes her so complicated
        but yet so...warm. So humane. And she wants to be loved. Not necessarily
        by anyone else but herself.
      </p>,
      <p>
        She wants to love herself. She makes a mental note to smile anytime she
        looks at the mirror. To understand that no one can be perfect but you
        can love yourself. To realize that you can't be everything you want but
        you can be content. To ascertain that you can't be anyone else, but you
        can be yourself.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Yes that imperfect, full of flaws and mistakes self. That not bad self.
        That beautiful self of hers which she will see, one day, truly.
      </p>,
      <p>
        And she can start now. To love herself today. Who knows, the love could
        grow bigger tomorrow.

        Month of love. <br />
        Always talk about expressing love to one another but have we come to
        terms with loving ourselves? Our flaws, our insecurities, our passion,
        our hobbies, things that make us stand out, do we love it all?
        Highlighting this month.

        The stranger tries to build up a conversation with me as we both stand
        before the wall, staring at the bond masterpiece—a painting of two
        abstract figures intertwined.
      </p>,
      <p>
        "Beautiful work of art. What do you think about people completing you?"
        he asks, his eyes still fixed on the painting. I know his question is
        being directed at me.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I lower my head a bit, a slow smile forming on my lips. "Completing me?"
        I echo, as if tasting the words. "Why would I spend years sculpting
        myself only to believe I’m unfinished?" I chuckle.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I giggle slightly. “Man, I'm engaged!” <br />
        He exhales after a while. “You don't believe in love then,” he says.
      </p>,
      <p>
        How best do I tell this man that loving myself, to the extent of letting
        me shine so bright and knowing I was worth every bit of it, came with
        the acceptance that I didn't need anyone to complete me? How do I tell
        him that on Valentine's Day, I gave myself a gift before anyone else
        did?
      </p>,
      <p>
        "I love my fiancé, but I'm not getting married to him because I seek
        someone to complete me. If I had a gap, I would work on fixing it before
        I get married. I wouldn't even dare look for a partner yet!" <br />
        He seems taken aback.
      </p>,
      <p>
        "What can I say? You’ve embraced yourself so well." He says after a
        short while and shrugs.
      </p>,
      <p>
        As much as I want to be humble, I cannot help but nod my head in
        acceptance of what he has just said. It took me a whole lot to let go of
        my insecurities and accept who I was.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I had to go through a lot of mind-cleansing from societal norms before I
        could stop asking AI why I was the way I was. Why wouldn't I be, after
        all? Where would my uniqueness lie, and how would I have found myself if
        I had come in the form society wanted me to come? And let's say I had
        come in that form—would they have loved me enough still?
      </p>,
      <p>
        They made me worry about fitting in, being liked, and being judged. I
        worried about my acne, my slim stature and my imperfect set of teeth. So
        what if they had begun to laugh at me when I was just still too little
        and didn't know what self-esteem was? If they hadn't seen a glimmer of
        fear and hatred for myself in my eyes, wouldn't they have backed off
        after a while?
      </p>,
      <p>
        At some point, I chose not to smile anymore. My glitter was hidden from
        the world just because I didn't want them to laugh at my teeth or my
        thick lips. I never believed it when anyone told me they loved my smile.
        “People love to pretend,” I said to myself.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Do you know how it feels to hate something about yourself? Especially
        when you hate it, not because it's bad, but because society says it is?
      </p>,
      <p>
        Sometimes, I worried I wasn't funny enough for my friends (whenever I
        had any). At other points, it was my dressing. I felt my fashion style
        didn't match that of my peers, and then later on, it was my voice which
        I felt wasn't good enough.
      </p>,
      <p>
        When I grew taller, I thought I was too tall, and to top it up, nobody
        ceased to tell me that I was growing taller by the day. In fact, I
        dreaded going to school because I didn't want to hear any of such
        comments. I thought the guys wouldn't like me because of the way I was.
        To think that I wanted them to fall in love with me in the first place.
        Why boys? Not even my destiny helpers.
      </p>,
      <p>
        There was so much to hate myself for. Especially when I saw people who
        had the things I didn't have. There was so much to dread myself for.{" "}
        <br />
        It was all in my head. <br />
        It was a mindset. <br />
        Just a mindset. <br />
        If you could read my mind then, you would think I was ugly. I was not at
        all.
      </p>,

        Insecurity is an obsessed blanket that wraps you and follows you
        everywhere you go. It sticks with you even in spite of your growth. It
        blinds you from seeing the good about you. You just have to pull it off,
        else you will never feel or think good about yourself, even if you're
        the best of persons.
      </p>,
      <p>
        "You know…I was a bad boy once," the man beside me starts talking,
        interrupting my thoughts. I shift my focus to him, waiting to hear what
        he has to say next.
      </p>,
      <p>
        "No be now wey I no fine again oh," he cracks a smile, and I cannot help
        but laugh over his goofiness.
      </p>,
      <p>
        He speaks so slowly that you will know what he has to say next before he
        says it. "Then, all the girls dem dey rush me. Some were there for the
        money, some for the fame. Everybody know me for uni. Na me all the girls
        dem wan follow."
      </p>,
      <p>
        I clap my hands sarcastically. "Wow. President general," I try to hide
        my laughter so he can go on. <br />
        "I played on their insecurities a lot." He folds his hands across his
        chest. <br />
        "The girls?"
      </p>,
      <p>
        "Yes, the girls," he replies. "Each of them all felt they were lacking
        something, and instead of seeking to get it for themselves, they looked
        onto me." <br />I do not let him land before I interrupt him.
      </p>,
      <p>
        "Omorr. Recently, someone told me her boyfriend was threatening to break
        up with her, and she was telling me to help her beg him. She said she
        could not do without him, that if he should leave her, her life would be
        done for. Obsession is real oh." I clap my hands together in a dramatic
        way.
      </p>,
      <p>
        "Same with those girls. They believed they needed me to be famous and to
        afford the lifestyle they wanted. Some even thought their ass was not
        big enough and no other guy would love them like that. I was their
        lifeline. Some had face card insecurities, so they clung to me like I
        was their life," He says.
      </p>,
      <p>
        "That's the thing. People want to be accepted by others. For me, I came
        to the realization that I was me. I had so many things at my advantage,
        so many things others did not have—things that made me stand out."
        <br />I look at him, as if to check if he is still following, and when I
        get the affirmative, I continue.
      </p>,
      <p>
        "I grabbed those advantages and modified them. Of course, I see girls
        who are more beautiful than I am in the sense that society thinks
        beautiful is, but I'm not moved. They cannot stand with me. They cannot
        even stand my confidence. There's so much confidence that comes with
        self-love and self-acceptance.
      </p>,
      <p>
        You have to accept the things you do not have and cannot have, else you
        will cling unto people that have these things or do not mind you not
        having these things—even at the expense of your self-worth.
      </p>,
      <p>
        So yes, I love my man. But he doesn't take away my flaws, I work on
        them. I love him, and he makes me a better person but doesn't make me
        whole. I was a complete person before we met, and that's what attracted
        him to me. I love him, but I will not lose my value because of that. I
        help his life as much as he helps mine. We're both aiming for
        perfection."
      </p>,
      <p>
        When I sense that I have been talking for too long, I look at my
        wristwatch and smile. "It was nice having this conversation with you
        here." He extends his hand for a handshake, and I take it.
      </p>,
      <p>
        As I walk out of the art gallery, my poise exuding confidence, I wonder
        why I didn’t even bother asking for his name.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Maybe I didn't want anything to do with him because he understands a
        part of me already, and further understanding might lead to something
        else.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I wonder within me how my mindset changed from “I’m not good enough” to
        “I’m good enough”. I will be lying if I say my self-love emerged from
        reading books or listening to a particular song.
      </p>,
      <p>
        It's a renewal of mind. A realization that everyone have flaws. We all
        do! But people shine still! As tiny-looking and distant as the star is,
        it's still a beautiful sight to behold and men spend hours staring at it
        without its knowing. If it hides itself, how would it shine and how
        would we learn of its existence?
      </p>,
      <p>I have learned to love myself and radiate self-love wherever I go.</p>,
