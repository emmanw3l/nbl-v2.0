      <p>
        All my life I've been carried by grace, His grace. Growing up I was
        taught about God, His power, His love and authority. I didn't just learn
        about God, I experienced Him in deliverance and Salvation. Still I had
        questions about who I was, who He was and what He wanted from me as my
        creator.
      </p>,
      <p>
        God is love. He sent his only son to die for my sake and that's divine,
        the purest form of love and I know why. He wanted me, He craved for my
        reconciliation with Him. I only just realised that God needs men and
        yes, He could use me too.
      </p>,
      <p>
        My soul was hungered, many times. I sought for it to be filled. I wanted
        to feel a connection with my creator. I searched and I found Him. It's
        not easy to find God but it's even more difficult for Him to abide in
        you. My relationship with God was not just father and daughter, He was a
        friend.
      </p>,
      <p>
        {" "}
        I connected most with Him when I came in utmost sincerity, vulnerable as
        I acknowledged my shortcomings and iniquities. I would sing to Him and
        He would move mountains for me.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I got on my knees in prayer and He heard my deepest heart desires before
        I spoke. I read his word daily, understanding His precepts and laws as
        he revealed his purpose and promises to me. Yes, He spoke to me in a
        still voice, calming the storms in my heart.
      </p>,
      <p>
        It went wrong. Instead of a blossoming relationship, it started to
        diminish and I know how. I started drifting away from the presence of my
        creator the moment I chose the cares of this world, I started chasing
        things irrelevant to Him. I was away from Him, His love and His covering
        but still, He never forsook me. That's love.
      </p>,
      <p>
        My questions were still unanswered. Some deep desires unmet, I wanted to
        discover God's purpose for my life so I could live the most fulfilled
        life, touching lives and pleasing my creator. So I had to trace my steps
        back because I missed that connection, I wanted God more than He needed
        me.
      </p>,
      <p>
        This new year, I made a decision to go back and I'm getting there, back
        to my first love. I started by reading my Bible daily, a verse to keep
        me through the day and I pray to my creator everyday, giving him thanks
        in supplication and asking for grace to carry me through. Yes, I had to
        cut off things that contended with my creators place, things that drew
        me away from Him, that's how I returned.
      </p>,
      <p>
        {" "}
        I traced my steps back by leaving some things behind. It'll cost you to
        be connected to the Creator but He is able to Help and carry you
        through. God is ever present, faithful and Just. This is the story of
        how I found God, strayed and returned. I am God's love daughter.

        A memory far from my vicinity <br />

        A reminder of the transcendence that I'll never regain. <br />

        I trace the steps of years gone by, <br />
        Where shadows once loomed, but now I fly. <br />
        A quiet faith, once just a spark, <br />
        Grew through the trials, grew through the dark <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        In moments when doubt whispered near, <br />
        I learned to trust, I learned not to fear. <br />
        Through stormy nights and days of pain, <br />
        I felt His presence, felt the rain. <br />

        Learning to walk in His holy grace. <br />

        I was young, my heart unformed, <br />
        When the weight of a storm took shape. <br />
        A fragile prayer escaped my lips, <br />
        A cry for help in fear's embrace. <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        The doctor’s words, a heavy stone, <br />
        Brought shadows to a childhood dream. <br />
        "Be strong," they said, "you’ll make it through," <br />
        But strength felt distant, hope unseen. <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        At night, I knelt with trembling hands, <br />
        My whispers rising to the skies: <br />
        “God, if You’re real, if You can hear, <br />
        Please stay beside me through this fight.” <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        A stillness settled in the room, <br />
        A warmth I couldn’t quite explain. <br />
        A voice like sunlight through the clouds: <br />
        "You are not alone in pain." <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        The valley stretched before my feet, <br />
        A path unknown, both dark and steep. <br />
        Yet every step was held by grace, <br />
        Each tear a prayer that ran so deep. <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        The hospital walls, so cold and bare, <br />
        Became a place where faith was born. <br />
        Through every hand that held me close, <br />
        I felt His love through every storm. <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        The nurse who smiled with gentle care, <br />
        The mother’s prayers that filled the air, <br />
        The surgeon’s skill, the healing hands— <br />
        God’s fingerprints were everywhere. <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        The day arrived, the moment came, <br />
        My body still, my spirit worn. <br />
        But through the haze of fear and pain, <br />
        A light within my soul was born. <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        It passed, and I awoke, <br />
        A scar now etched upon my skin. <br />
        At first, I wept, for all it marked <br />
        Was what I’d lost, what might have been. <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        But soon I saw, with clearer eyes, <br />
        This scar was not a sign of pain. <br />
        It spoke of grace, of battles won, <br />
        Of how my faith would not remain. <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        The valley didn’t break my heart; <br />
        It built a bridge from fear to trust. <br />
        Through every trial, through every tear, <br />
        I found a God whose love is just. <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        Now, when I stand and see that mark, <br />
        I see a journey, not a wound. <br />
        A story told in lines of hope, <br />
        Of how my faith has been attuned. <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        Scars are not only signs of pain; <br />
        They show the roads we’ve walked through fire. <br />
        They speak of strength that God provides, <br />
        Of grace that lifts us ever higher. <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        So here I stand, His work complete, <br />
        Yet always growing, always new. <br />
        Each step I take, each breath I breathe, <br />
        A testament to love that’s true. <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        For through the valley, I was led, <br />
        By unseen hands, through darkest night. <br />
        And now I walk, forever held, <br />
        Within the bounds of endless light. <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        For in my journey, I'd come to see, <br />
        That every trail was shaping me . <br />
        Your love, my anchor , steadfast and strong . <br />
        Through every valley, you carried my along <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        So let this prayer be my song of praise, <br />
        To the God who redeems,who lights my days. <br />
        Forever I will walk with you by my side , <br />
        My saviour, my Healer, my faithful guide. <br />

        As I ponder the mysteries of God, I am struck by the paradox of His
        nature. He is the infinite, all-powerful Creator who exists beyond space
        and time, yet He desires a personal relationship with us, His finite
        creations.
      </p>,
      <p>
        My own relationship with God has been a rocky road, filled with doubts
        and fears. I often struggle to understand Him, feeling unworthy of His
        love. But as I reflect on His character, I am reminded that He hates
        sin, not me. He longs to forgive and cleanse me, making me white as
        snow.
      </p>,
      <p>
        A wise saying echoes in my mind: "Life is a bed of roses, but with
        thorns." Trials and tribulations will come, but with God, I can face
        them with courage and hope. Even Jesus suffered during His time on
        earth, so who am I to expect an easy life?
      </p>,
      <p>
        God's desire is for me to have a personal, intimate relationship with
        Him. He wants me to talk to Him like a friend, to open His Word, and to
        place my burdens on Him. He rejoices when I repent and turn to Him.
      </p>,
      <p>
        As I look back on my life, I am overwhelmed with gratitude for God's
        goodness. He has protected me and my loved ones, provided for us, and
        given us new opportunities. His blessings are countless, and I am
        humbled by His love.
      </p>,
      <p>
        In the midst of life's challenges, I will draw nearer to God, seeking
        His guidance, comfort, and strength. May my relationship with Him
        continue to grow, and may I always remember His faithfulness and love.

        Humans are not invulnerable, and the arrows of life have wounded many.
        Some strut about with festering wounds, pretending not to notice the
        stench or discomfort. Eventually, they would realise an athlete with a
        festering wound cannot run fast or go far.

        I stopped pretending long ago, instead I sought for a fresh salve to

      <p>
        Oh, and I've had dark days—even while I had a good relationship with
        God. On such occasions, I mediate on scriptures, pray and journal. These
        practices help my troubled soul connect with God's presence. I'd liken
        his presence to a precious, sweet fragrance. It rejuvenates me each time
        I catch a whiff.

        It's been a lovely journey thus far. It blows my mind in the most
        wonderful way to think that the Master of the universe, the one who has
        the earth in his hands—calls me his friend and cares for me
        wholeheartedly. I'm definitely looking forward to delving deeper in my
        walk with God.

        Some people will agree that as soon as we are born into a family, we are
        born into the choices we think are right for the household. The
        decisions are based on our basic needs and sometimes our free will. As
        you get older, you realize that you must find yourself outside of what
        is set for you, outside of your childhood and beliefs.

        2024 was a year that I was stuck between miracles and coincidences. I
        encountered struggles my mouth couldn’t describe and my eyes couldn’t
        behold, but my faith became the anchor I didn’t know I needed. I won’t
        say that I saw myself as a representative of what I believed in, but
        along the way, I was dealing with the complexities of being human.
      </p>,
      <p>
        There were moments when all I had was a silent mouth and a grieving
        heart so heavy it felt like I didn’t matter in the place God made me. My
        tears spoke louder than words ever could, soothing the pain I tried so
        hard to ignore. But on other days, there was a joy that came with quiet
        mornings, the moment when I was free of doubt and full of
        clarity—moments where my heart gets reshaped by my maker.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Going closer to God has made me see the light. I have realized that I
        was created in His image and likeness, according to his word. Outside of
        Sunday services, I found joy in expressing myself in prayer. It was
        about being with him rather than asking him things. In a way, my writing
        got better by the day. It allowed me to explore my passion and build
        connections with other things I love. I have learned to find myself
        following my faith and embrace all flaws, well some as God’s design.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Regardless of my progress, there were times when I found it challenging
        to pursue specific interests. There were periods when I wondered if it
        was ever “Christian enough” or if I was caught up in trying to make bad
        decisions. I couldn’t possibly forget times I questioned my beliefs.
        Situations had a habit of putting me in a position that messed with my
        thinking. I began to put myself in challenges I wasn’t experiencing,
        asking questions I knew the answers to and living in doubt.
      </p>,
      <p>
        But I realized one doesn’t need to follow script. His love wasn’t tied
        to how perfect I was but to my authenticity. I wasn’t stuck in a box
        trying to figure things out but given the freedom to grow. Looking back
        on the previous year, I was grateful, knowing that I was a child of God
        uniquely crafted for a purpose.

        If I was asked on a stage to talk about my relationship with God, I
        would have a million things to say but at the same time nothing at all.
        It’s strange how you can feel both overflowing with emotion and yet, at
        the same time, completely speechless. It’s like trying to explain
        something so deep and personal that no words could ever do it justice.
        But if I were to begin, I would ask this question,
      </p>,
      <p>
        Have you ever been under water? If not then we're the same cause I
        haven't either but I've had that feeling, that suffocating feeling like
        being pulled slowly beneath the surface, I don't come up,I just keep
        sinking, deeper and deeper till I feel life slowly leave me. But I don't
        really die.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Then one day, in the midst of that darkness, something incredible
        happened. A hand stretched forward and pulled me up to the surface. He
        never wanted me wet, cold or sad. I was meant for the light and the
        beautiful things it had for me. I realized that I was loved—more deeply
        than I ever imagined.
      </p>,
      <p>
        He was so full of love, His hand, still wrapped around mine, was a
        lifeline that had pulled me from the depths of despair. I felt seen,
        heard, and understood in a way that I never had before.
      </p>,
      <p>
        In that moment, I knew that I was meant for more. I was meant to walk in
        the light, to bask in the warmth of love and connection. I was meant to
        live, to thrive, and to flourish. And with him by my side, I knew that
        anything was possible! Oh how wrong was I to think I wasn't loved, he
        was always there!
      </p>,
      <p>
        I had been wrong for so long to believe that I was unloved, that I
        wasn’t worthy of His care. I thought I was just a stain, something
        broken and dirty that no one would care to clean up. But He didn’t see
        me like that. He saw me as fearfully and wonderfully made. He saw all of
        me—the broken parts, the struggles, the failures—and still chose to love
        me.
      </p>,
      <p>
        But even though I was saved, even though I knew I was loved, there were
        still times when I felt like I was sinking again. The weight of life
        would press down on me, the doubts would resurface, and I’d feel like I
        was drowning all over again. But this time, I knew something was
        different. He was still there, always there. His hand was still
        outstretched, ready to pull me back up when I needed it. And when I
        couldn’t pull myself up, He was there to do it for me.
      </p>,
      <p>
        And I know, no matter how deep I sink, He will always be there to rescue
        me. God became my life jacket, my anchor in the storm, my savior when
        everything else seemed lost. He is the constant in my life, the one who
        never lets go. Even in the depths of despair, even when the world around
        me feels like it's dragging me under, He is the one who pulls me back to
        the surface. With Him, I am never truly lost.

        The wind was a prophet, the sea a psalm, <br />
        Mountains stood still as a prayer unspoken. <br />
        And there, in the hush of creation’s breath, <br />
        I found His name in the stones, unbroken <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        This name, not carved by mortal hands, <br />
        Not tethered to time or the spoken tongue, <br />
        But etched in the sweep of a sparrow’s flight <br />
        And sung where galaxies are strung. <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        I heard it where morning kisses the soil, <br />
        Where dew weeps soft on the brow of the earth, <br />
        And in the cry of a child’s first breath, <br />
        A whisper of glory, a hymn of birth. <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        It was painted in hues of a setting sun, <br />
        In shadows that linger when light retreats, <br />
        And in the fireflies stitching the night, <br />
        A testament written in countless beats. <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        Yet, it was not in the stars He was most, <br />
        Not in the roar of seas or the sun’s wide reach— <br />
        But in the stillness, the gap between heartbeats, <br />
        Where love stoops low, soft as a breach. <br />
      </p>,
       <p>
              He is not a God of distance or grandeur, <br/>
              Though splendor swirls like gold in His name. <br/>
              He is the weaver of wounds into wonder, <br/>
              The fire that refines, yet loves the flame. <br/>

            </p>,
            <p>
              O, how the heavens hold back their applause, <br/>
              For even their brilliance cannot contain <br/>
              The grace that stooped to cradle the cross, <br/>
              Where justice bowed and mercy reigned. <br/>

            </p>,
            <p>
              What is man, that You breathe Your stars in him? <br/>
              That Your scars would meet us in fragile clay? <br/>
              You are the paradox—eternal and near, <br/>
              The God who dies to become the Way. <br/>

            </p>,
            <p>
              I have no laurels fit for Your crown, <br/>
              No words vast enough to hold Your name. <br/>
              Yet, here I stand, a reed in Your storm, <br/>
              Bent by grace, yet unbroken by flame. <br/>

            </p>,
            <p>
              Your name is whispered in the quiet night, <br/>
              Where the weary pour out their silent plea. <br/>
              It’s the anchor that holds through the fiercest storm, <br/>
              The song in the heart of eternity. <br/>

            </p>,
            <p>
              Your glory fills both the vast and the small, <br/>
              From galaxies spun to the sparrow’s fall. <br/>
              You are the breath in each fleeting moment, <br/>
              The voice that answers every call. <br/>

            </p>,
             <p>
              Though empires crumble and time shall fade, <br/>
              Your name will endure, steadfast and true. <br/>
              It is the thread that weaves all creation, <br/>
              The hope of the old and the spark of the new. <br/>

            </p>,
            <p>
              I felt it then—a shiver, a shadow, <br/>
              A cold that pierced where no fire could burn. <br/>
              In the void, where stars are devoured by silence, <br/>
              Is this where Your mercy will not return? <br/>

            </p>,
            <p>
              And when my voice is a fleeting ember, <br/>
              Swallowed by tides of eternity’s sea, <br/>
              Let it cry only this: Holy, holy, holy, <br/>
              For all I am begins and ends in Thee. <br/>

            </p>,
            <p>
              If the frost reaches even the throne of grace, <br/>
              Who will dare rise to meet Your face? <br/>

    title: "A dance with death",
    author: "Craig",
    content: [
      <p>
              In the bustling town of Awka, Anambra, a boy named Obi was born into the world with a secret. From his
              first moments, his presence seemed otherworldly. By age seven, Obi revealed to his younger sister, Ada,
              that he was the reincarnation of their grandfather, Eze Anya, a man whose wisdom had shaped their family
              decades ago. He recounted tales of his past life with eerie precision and described his journey through
              the spirit realm—a place between life and death.
            </p>,
            <p>
              Obi told Ada of a world beyond human understanding, where souls danced in light and shadow, moving toward
              their next existence. He spoke of Heaven and Hell, but not as places of punishment or reward. “They are
              states of being,” he explained, “woven into the fabric of our lives.”
            </p>,
            <p>
              By twelve, Obi’s teachings had outgrown his sister’s quiet belief. His parents, initially skeptical, were
              stunned by his intimate knowledge of their family history—secrets only Eze Anya could have known. Soon,
              Obi began sharing his wisdom with the community, unraveling the mysteries of Heaven and Hell through
              esoteric lessons that captivated the youth.
            </p>,
            <h4>"Heaven And Hell"</h4>,
            <p>
              Standing beneath the ancient baobab tree, Obi often addressed small crowds, his voice calm but commanding.
              “Heaven and Hell,” he began, “are not places we go when we die. They are not fiery pits or golden gates.
              They are choices we make, states we embody, both in this life and beyond.”
            </p>,
             <p>
              Hell, on the other hand, was the result of disconnection—from oneself, from others, and from the divine.
              “Hell is not punishment,” Obi said. “It is the suffering we create when we reject our true nature. When we
              act out of fear, hatred, or ignorance, we burn—not in flames, but in the torment of separation from love
              and light.” In another light we can see hell as an alternate state of lower vibration and frequency,an
              animalistic place where souls have the opportunity to learn evolve and even re-create into a heaven.It is
              a school meant to teach and guide you into higher realms.
            </p>,
            <p>
              Obi’s teachings challenged the traditional beliefs of his community. He described the afterlife not as a
              judgment day but as a continuation of one’s inner state. “If you carry Heaven within you, you ascend into
              higher realms of existence. But if you carry Hell, you are trapped, reliving your pain until you learn to
              let go.”
            </p>,
            <h4>The Spirit World</h4>,
            <p>
              Obi also shared vivid accounts of his time between lives. He described a vast expanse of light and sound,
              where souls gathered to reflect on their earthly journeys. “It is a place of healing,” he said, “where we
              shed the weight of our past and prepare for the next dance.”
            </p>,
            <p>
              He spoke of meeting other souls, of witnessing their journeys and learning from their stories. He
              described the divine as a vast, unknowable energy—neither man nor woman, but a presence that filled the
              universe. “God does not judge,” he told his listeners. “God teaches. Heaven and Hell are not His
              creations. They are ours.”
            </p>,
            <h4>Legacy</h4>,
            <p>
              Despite his wisdom, Obi was no saint. He wasn’t your typical humble religious guy,he spoke with power ,
              people around him knew he was anointed and appointed by the Divine. By sixteen, he succumbed to the
              pressures of his dual existence. Drugs became his escape, his mortal body straining under the weight of
              his eternal soul. Yet even as his physical form deteriorated, his teachings grew brighter, spreading
              across Awka and beyond.
            </p>,
            <p>
              When he died of cancer at eighteen, Obi left behind a legacy that would outlive him. Songs were written
              about his esoteric teachings. His words echoed in academic papers, and his name became a symbol of
              enlightenment.
            </p>,
            <p>
              For his sister Ada, Obi’s teachings were not just words but a map to navigate life’s mysteries. She often
              remembered his whispered words: “Heaven and Hell are the dances we choose. When we find the rhythm of
              love, we ascend. When we lose it, we fall. But the dance never ends.”

              READER'S FATE
            </h4>,
            <h5>
              I found the journal of the infamous Saint John.
            </h5>,
            <p><i className="bi bi-star"></i></p>,
            <p>
              As bland as life can be everyone has their up moments. Mine happened when I was forced to take a test.
              This being one of my life's exciting moments surely this isn't no ordinary test I'm talking about.
            </p>,
            <p>
              It was a test of credibility. Credibility to the society I found myself residing in at the time. A test in
              which failure meant a fast and sure an end as death. At that age I'd barely lived life to my satisfaction
              to have my demise knocking at my door already.
            </p>,
            <p>
              Some might think it uncivil to have such a burden placed on my head as a child as young as I was. However
              this test was as civil as it was the norm of our society so much so that my family had my preparations
              sought to and ordained under strict supervision. My family being my father and stepsister who didn't take
              kindly to me much as I wasn't actually related to her. In actuality I was a foreigner to the entire town
              not just my sister or my father and it was the actions and decisions of .y late mother that led to it
              being so. Much family drama concurred in the early years of my birth between my father his ex wife and my
              mother I wouldn't like to dwell on given the little I am sure of on the matter.
            </p>,
            <p>
              Life is bland even with any drama, when all of it is hellbent on tests exams and passing to survive and
              the one ahead was no less of the exception. It was the test my whole life pivoted on and I couldn't do
              much as flop or it'd be the end of me. The community self imposing the roles of judge, jury and
              executioner
              pressured my father the role of supervisor.
            </p>,
            <p>
              All while coincidentally my birthday of joyous occasion decided to fall on the eve of the big day. My
              answer
              to all the anticipation built-up was to run. Run from it all and so I did as anyone would. Run from a
              problem this big and growing. My examination.
            </p>,


            <p> Then I awoke. I woke up the next day wrote the test and passed it no sweat. </p>,
            <h5 className="text-center">THE END</h5>,
            <p>
              An exciting experience I would call it. The dread I had formed over a paper I was more than prepared for
              only to meet the anticlimax of success at the end. Excitement was the overthinking and the dreams. The
              dreams were where the fun of it all was at.
            </p>,
            <p>
              In them I had given everyone roles with the thought of escape ever more a reality.
            </p>,
            <p>
              My dark oppressors turned vampires. Father, sister and community into bloodthirsty creatures of the night
              ready for the hunt. My truancy would become an adventure through fantastical lands and magical towns of
              various races. My exam would be drenched in more malice and less hope of ever getting done and over with.
            </p>,
            <p>
              I myself underwent change in this lucid dream of mine. Becoming a character I'd read of once in a book.
              John the beholder, honored one amongst all man. His life and my problems seemed to be in sync with one
              another.
            </p>,
            <p>
              My somewhat intrusive overthinking became as high a stake as his impending peril. As strange as it was I
              woke up.
            </p>,
            <p>
              Got out of bed went for a glass of water prayed by my bedside and reassured myself I was aptly prepared
              for the day ahead.
            </p>,
            <p>
              I went back to bed with saner thoughts never to dream again of THE REVELATION.
            </p>,
            <p>
              Prayer has always been my way to transcend the physical dimension into the spiritual one. <br/><br/>
              I concur, Dreams are also a path however they behave more spontaneously and sometimes uncontrollable.
              Intellectual emotional and social aspects of one's life creating a likely fantasy however unlikely it may
              seem. Hence the wise put it simply that dreams have their metaphoric meaning. <br/><br/>
              Prayer is my way to rope the chaotic dreams I have and seek answers from God in the way I will understand.

            </p>,
            <p>
              Most unnatural occurrences are beyond human experience but lean towards spirituality. There is relief in
              journeying one's spiritual self now to further cope with the things we cannot control or explain. I am
              forever grateful to God for every life experience He has shown my way.

              Who never grows old and weary. <br/>
              I am his spitting image. <br/>
              Who lives to die for his glory. <br/>

            </p>,
            <p>
              He giveth thy angels charge over me <br/>
              Therefore, I am charged to carry on <br/>
              I dine in the shadow of the Almighty, <br/>
              As I will party with thee on the last day. <br/>

            </p>,
            <p>
              He loved the world so much. <br/>
              And gave us his beloved son. <br/>
              Who passed in the shade of the sun <br/>
              We live now in his grace and mercy. <br/>

            </p>,
            <p>
              Harken not to thy flesh. <br/>
              For we are not of this world <br/>
              We are just passerby’s <br/>
              Who lives only by his words. <br/>

            <h4>Reminisce of Transcendence</h4>,
            <h5 className="text-center">November 26th, 2024, the day I encountered the creator of the universe. </h5>,
            <p>
              “Heavenly Father, show me your dwelling place, " I murmured in my timid prayer. Amidst my mixed
              feelings of faith and doubt, something fell off my eyes like scales, and before me, it was the most
              beautiful thing I had ever seen in my entire life. The entrance to the creator’s dwelling place coated
              in shades of colour that didn’t exist in reality. In my fright and anxiousness, I walked into his
              inner court. Before me, in the middle of his court, was a gigantic staff covered in fine gold, and at
              her zenith were seven stars dancing around her in a parade.
            </p>,
            <p>
              Behind the almighty throne was a huge white eagle whose eyes were too bright for me to gaze at. On
              both opposites of the staff were the ancient elders seated in his glory, gazing at the core of his
              divinity.
            </p>,
            <p>
              Before me was the great one whose glory I couldn’t gaze at, for I nearly lost my sight at my first and
              only attempt. I finally decided to rest my gaze on his feet, which rested on the surface of the
              firmament. Yes, the firmament he used in separating the water below from the water above during
              ancient times.
            </p>,
            <p>
              At the right-hand side of his court was the most beautiful waterfall known to my sight. Below the
              waterfall were burning flames of fire that never grew wary despite their continuous encounter with the
              waters pouring down the fall.
            </p>,
            <p>
              “What is this?” I asked myself because I have never seen such science in my life. “Was the fire too
              hot for the water to overcome?” I pondered in my spirit. Looking at the height of the fall, I knew
              this was beyond human comprehension. This was the manifestation of the great one who was there before
              ancient times.
            </p>,
             <p>
              Around the extreme edges of the court were souls who were once like me, singing in languages and
              frequencies of sounds I couldn’t comprehend. These souls knew no slumber; they sang and worshipped the
              almighty come day and night in every season and time known to the universe.
            </p>,
            <p>
              To be in his presence was the highest level of serenity I have ever attained in my human life. In his
              mercy, I found fulfillment. I would give anything to stay in his presence for all eternity, but I was
              brought back to reality in the twinkle of an eye.
            </p>,
            <p>
              “What is this, Lord?” Why reveal all of these things without saying a word to me?
            </p>,
            <p>
              He said, “I wanted you to get a glimpse of what your future would look like if you stopped running
              from me. You have chosen to nurture everything good that I have given to you outside of my presence. I
              wanted you to see that everything good that has happened to you and will keep happening to you, is
              because I created you! Should it then be good that you choose to enjoy all of these things outside my
              presence?
            </p>,
            <p>
              He had brought to my awareness his intentions for me and reminded me that his dwelling place is man’s
              natural environment, for only when he created us did he turn to Himself and speak.
            </p>,
            <p className="text-center">

 <p>
              My journey in spirituality is one too deep to dwell on, <br/>
              So a tiny bit I would reveal. <br/>
              Raw it may seem, but it is raw! <br/>

            </p>,
            <p>
              In a journey, one has to know His direction and destination, <br/>
              Well, I didn't know any of this in this particular journey. <br/>

            </p>,
            <p>
              Jesus held my hands and led me all the way,
            </p>,
            <p>
              He br/ought people who taught me accountability and the scriptures, people who fired me on,
            </p>,
            <p>
              Who could do this alone by the way?
            </p>,
            <p>
              The journey was tough, I must say, <br/>
              Yet, it was worthwhile still, <br/>
              As I began, I asked myself if I could continue, if I could stay, <br/>
              Well...here I am still. <br/>

            </p>,
            <p>
              I didn't know I could hear Him speak and I thought visions were fantasies until I was ready at heart for
              them, <br/>
              How can one say God is unfair to speak to one and ignore another? <br/>
              I nodded to the realization that He had always been speaking. <br/>

            </p>,
            <p>
              I had so many questions to ask and I still do, <br/>
              I didn't believe God knew everything until I asked Him so many br/ain-racking questions and He answered
              all.

            </p>,
            <p>
              I tested Him and He passed,
            </p>,
            <p>
              I needed to know what God wanted from me, <br/>
              I began to say, ‘Daddy, what's our next move’

            </p>,
            <p>
              I was tired of taking and taking without giving, <br/>
              The sooner I realized no relationship progressed without effective communication, the better it became for
              me and Him. <br/>
              I kept Him company and He did the same for me.

            </p>,
            <p>
              I cried to Him and He made me laugh. <br/>
              I babbled and He cared to listen to my unformed and unclear words, like a mother to her suckling child.
              She must listen, whether she understands or not, because the child has desires and she wants to fulfill
              them. <br/>
              He was always there, patiently. <br/>
              Sometimes I would go the extra mile to spread a wrapper before me on the bed and invite Him to sit with
              me. <br/>
              "Daddy, I want to rant." Coz why not?

            </p>,
            <p>
              Yes, I took servitude, worship and honour to God personal! I take am rub body <br/>
              I realized I had to pleasure to be pleasured, <br/>
              I couldn't take it anymore at one point and I said 'Lord if you won't direct me, take my life'.

            </p>,
            <p>
              Well, He did take my life even as He directed my path, <br/>
              Countless times I tapped on those tiles, overlaid with uncontrollable burdens, screaming, wailing and
              rolling like my life was being dragged by the one who made me, <br/>
              I needed something more, <br/>
              Something not rare, something cheap, but not often desired, <br/>
              Maybe often desired, but do we tarry long enough for it? <br/>
              The desire is inherent in so many.

            </p>,
            <p>
              I knew I had so many opportunities to defile myself, <br/>
              I had so many opportunities to depart from the path, <br/>
              For me to follow this path, knees were scraped, heads shook, sweats dropped and hands remained glued to
              the
              floor, <br/>
              I knew all of this and I couldn't take it for granted.
            </p>,
            <p>
              After all, something had been written of me, <br/>
              I asked questions, I heard and I confirmed, <br/>
              My only regret was not yielding early enough. <br/>
              Infact, I want to yield more and I still ask that He take my life even after He had taken it.

            </p>,
            <p>
              I knew it was time to follow hard after God, <br/>
              If His mercy found me and disallowed me from straying, why should I be ordinary? <br/>
              I flipped the pages of the Great Book, prayed stretches, long midnight prayers, <br/>
              Until mom began to wonder, "what has happened to my baby?".

            </p>,
            <p>
              I heard, “Many have caught this fire before you. They failed.” <br/>
              I would catch it nevertheless! <br/>
              This I said to myself. <br/>
              I resolved to do anything possible for God not to leave me, <br/>
              I kept tongues under my br/eath, making sure there was not an hour spent without him.

            </p>,
            <p>
              Before I realized how true He was to His Word when He said He would never leave me nor forsake me, I
              thought I could blackmail Him with my tears. <br/>
              Then it dawned on me!
            </p>,
             <p>
              I realized I couldn't get what I wanted, <br/>
              The yearning and desire grew deeper, <br/>
              The more I knew, the farther I went, the deeper I got in.

            </p>,
            <p>
              I was trapped and I couldn't go back.
            </p>,
            <p>
              Whether I cried and begged Him to stay with me or not, He wanted to spend my life and make it His anyway,
              <br/>
              My Lord became an addiction capable of defeating all other addictions, <br/>
              What used to seem like a mere duty of one who was borne by a clergyman now became a lifestyle for me.

            </p>,
            <p>
              It wasn't long before I realized Christianity was not my religion, <br/>
              Christ lived inside of me and I lived in Him, <br/>
              He, my identity and personality. <br/>
              I never once thought of br/eaking up with him, <br/>
              Although I had fleeting thoughts of how life would be if I could take it easy, slow and not be termed
              “Holy holy, Assistant Jesus”.

            </p>,
            <p>
              Sometimes, I stopped my long prayers totally but He never gave up on me, <br/>
              There was so much astake if I did not pray. My children, future, family, generation, ministry, education,
              <br/>
              He even went as far as awakening me Himself and whispering soft melodies into my ears, <br/> “wake up,
              Grace!
              You can't be asleep when you have me”

            </p>,
            <p>
              I won't lie, it felt like religious duties sometimes. I detested the times I knew I had to pray some days,
            </p>,
              <p>
              But as I grew, prayer became my lifestyle and I ate it, <br/>
              I still yearn to pray more before I get old and I swore to my mom I wouldn't pray small.

            </p>,
            <p>
              How sweet He was that I resolved never to hide Him from anybody! <br/>
              And I mean anybody! They had better know I'm a child of God and not just a "church girl" <br/>
              Infact, that's a crazy thing to call a person. <br/>
              My relationship with Him was not tied to my church-going. It was in my heart, in my room! <br/> Toor!

            </p>,
            <p>
              In all, He taught me a lot. <br/>
              I loved, trusted and followed shamelessly. <br/>
              Miracles, healings, impartations, evangelisms are on a whole different phase, perfectly regular for a
              believer.

            </p>,
            <p>
              I learnt above all that I could be the daughter of a clergy, be used by God to do signs and wonders,
              preach the gospel, be of a good behavior, serve God and not know Him,
              My intimacy with God would always come before every other thing that followed.

            </p>,
            <p>
              I would say my life as a christian did get me alienated from the world, <br/>
              But I soon realized how much of a blessing I had gotten.

            </p>,
            <p>
              Challenges did come, but then who goes challenges?
            </p>,
            <p>
              Knowing that before I was born He chose me and already drafted out a plan for my life was all the
              prerequisites I needed for peace and joy,
            </p>,
            <p>
              Not once did I doubt Him or regret doing all I did to foster my relationship with Him.
            </p>,
            <p>
              Of course, a few times I was tempted to ask why he took away my friends and denied me access to music that
              didn't glorify Him, but I loved Him all the more,
            </p>,
            <p>
              I just kept asking for His grace to do more for Him and everything followed in 2024.
