        CAN I RISE UP, when everything is shattered and broken? When everything
        I’ve ever loved, cared for, dreamed of is gone? When everything I’ve
        ever protected has gone? Disappearing out of sight.
      </p>,
      <p>
        At that beginning it seemed so easy. It seemed like all I had to do was
        to love enough, want it enough, hold onto it enough. But that’s
        apparently not enough.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I realized that life doesn’t give us entirely everything we want. It
        doesn’t open up just for us, it doesn’t have to hand us something just
        because we love it or even worked hard for it. They’re some things that
        just won’t work out, not because we didn’t give it our best, or didn’t
        love or want it enough. And I learned that late, too late. <br />
        So of course, the question still remains, can I rise up?
      </p>,
      <p>
        Maybe. Maybe I can rise up, from the heartbreak, disappointments and
        sadness. It’s definitely better than feeling sorry for myself or
        wallowing in my misery. It’s so better than blaming myself for wanting
        too much or holding on too much.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Because the fact is, we are never wrong or greedy for wanting something
        we care so much for. We are never wrong fighting to reach the sky either
        our wings are small or big. The only wrong that exist is the inequal
        scale in life which makes the sky easy for others and hard for others.
        No matter how hard we push or levitate, we might find gravity fighting
        against us and pulling us down.
      </p>,
      <p>
        So what can we do? Settle for less and live looking up at the sky which
        we dared to claim. Tch, I say we rather try our hardest. To try our best
        again and again so we won’t have any regrets. To hold on a little bit
        longer, to be patient and be audacious, to risk, to grow, to be
        intentional, to keep fighting.
      </p>,
      <p>Perhaps, we can truly rise up and beat the wind.</p>,

        Do you know how it feels when all these emotions- feelings weigh on you
        it’s like you are on the ground trying and struggling to get up but you
        cannot because they keep holding onto you they tell you it’s all your
        fault and you believe them because after all is true, everything is all
        your fault.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Memories of your rapist touching you, telling you everything that’s
        happening is because of what you were wearing, it’s because of your
        stupidity; of course you do not have any right to rise up. Everything
        happened because of you. You guess that’s why you did not scream that
        day, you knew.
      </p>,
      <p>
        You are meant to be on the ground, suffering and letting the
        emotion-your guilt eat you inside out. <br />
        Just then, a faint voice familiar to you whispered into your ear. “It’s
        not your fault, sweetie.” <br />
        Your eyes started overflowing with tears, a salty flood tracing paths
        down your cheeks.
      </p>,
      <p>
        The pain, a tightly coiled knot held for so long, began to unravel. A
        strangled sound escaped your throat, escalating into a raw scream that
        echoed the years of silent suffering. <br />
        <br />
        Your hands, as if possessed by a desperate need to erase the violation,
        scrubbed at your skin, the friction leaving it burning and red.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Then, as suddenly as the storm had erupted, a fragile quiet descended. A
        sense of something shifting, a hairline crack in the wall of guilt,
        washed over you. <br />
        You still trembled, the echo of the sobs shaking your small frame. You
        didn’t know where the seed of courage bloomed from, but it was there, a
        tiny spark in the darkness.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Your voice, still thin and unsteady, formed the question that had been
        buried for so long: “Can I rise up?” Your hands remained clenched, a
        silent plea held within their tight grasp.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Another wave of emotion washed over you – not pain this time, but a
        profound and unexpected warmth. It enveloped you like a familiar
        embrace, a comforting presence you hadn’t realized you were yearning
        for. Her scent, the faint sweetness of home, filled your senses. “Can I
        live all this guilt behind?” you whispered, the question a fragile
        breath in the stillness.
      </p>,
      <p>
        And then, the unwavering answer, filled with a love that transcended the
        pain: “Yes, my sweetie. Yes.” The warmth intensified, a promise of
        healing and the slow, steady climb towards the light.

        There is this looming baggage ladled all over me, <br />
        Attempting to lift my head up in vain <br />
        Drowning in an endless sea of my guilts and past mistakes, <br />
        Everything an echo of my haunting pain.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I hear faint whispers and cries urging me to rise up <br />
        And bring my face up above the waters. <br />
        I struggle instinctively to do so, <br />
        But the crashing weight of the waves are so strong <br />
        That I have to ask myself <i> can I rise up?</i>
      </p>,
      <p>
        The waters close above me, a suffocating shroud <br />
        Memories of failures, regrets, and unfulfilled dreams allowed <br />
        To haunt me, taunt me, and pull me down <br />
        Into the dark abyss, where hope’s lost, and fears are found
      </p>,
      <p>
        Yet still I yearn to break the surface, <br />
        To breathe the air and feel the sun’s warm touch. <br />
        I search for strength in every fiber, <br />
        And find the will to rise, to overcome and clutch.
      </p>,
      <p>
        With every stroke, I push the weights aside, <br />
        And slowly, steadily, I begin to glide. <br />
        The whispers grow to cheers, the cries to songs, <br />
        As I rise up, and my spirit starts to belong.
      </p>,
      <p>
        The waves still crash, the currents still sway, <br />
        But I’ve found a rhythm, a way to navigate the bay. <br />
        I’ve learned to ride the waves, to face the tide, <br />
        And find the strength to rise, to be my best inside.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Can I rise up? Yes, I can, I will, <br />
        For in the depths, I’ve found a strength that’s real. <br />
        I’ll face the waves, I’ll ride the tide, <br />
        And emerge triumphant, my spirit inside.
      </p>,
      <p>
        The baggage still weighs, the memories still sting, <br />
        But I’ve learned to carry them, to let them sing. <br />
        Their song is one of lessons learned, of growth and of pain, <br />
        A reminder of the strength I harbor. <br />
        I’ll answer the call, I’l wave the stall, I’ll face the sun, <br />
        And let my spirit soar.

        Would it be possible to rise <br />
        When my world is crumbling around me? <br />
        When my voice feels like a whisper, <br />
        I am drowned out by louder truths and by my tears? <br />
        When each of my step forward seems uncertain <br />
        And every of my breath is heavy with memories? <br />
        When my doubt takes root in my chest, <br />
        Pounding so many questions against my heart? <br />
        When mirrors reflect more of my scars than my smiles, <br />
        And my dreams lie silent at my feet <br />
        Like petals bruised by the cold?
      </p>,
      <p>
        I’ve stumbled— <br />
        More times than I can recall. <br />
        Some falls were loud, some quiet, <br />
        Some cloaked in shame, others in silence <br />
        Not noticed by anyone but me. <br />
        Through the night I weep myself to sleep <br />
        I’ve lain on cold floors, <br />
        Urging my soul to awaken. <br />
        Despite the pain of past words, <br />
        The weight of unmet potential, <br />
        The echo of missed chances <br />
        And hands I failed to hold?
      </p>,
      <p>
        <br />
        They said standing was simple, <br />
        Just rise. <br />
        But they didn’t see the mud weighing me down, <br />
        The way grief entwines with my shadow, <br />
        How fear clings to me like a second skin.

      <p>
        Yet— <br />
        A flicker stirs in the ashes. <br />
        A heartbeat. A whisper. A possibility. <br />
        What if I’m more than my falls? <br />
        What if I am more than my flaws? <br />
        And what if there’s a spark residing within me <br />
        That hope cannot extinguish?

      <p>
        <span className="h3">CAN I RISE UP</span> <br />
        With knees scraped from effort? <br />
        With a voice unsure if it is mine? <br />
        With truths that may waver <br />
        But never deceive?
      </p>,
      <p>
        Yes— <br />
        Let me rise with the dawn, <br />
        Not perfectly, not swiftly, <br />
        But with intention. <br />
        Let me gather every fractured piece <br />
        And create a strong strength.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Let me rise <br />
        For the child I once was, <br />
        Who believed in stars, and fairytales <br />
        And for the future self <br />
        That waits on the horizon yearning for something greater
      </p>,
      <p>
        I will rise <br />
        Like oceans carving through stone, <br />
        Like songs remembered in silence, <br />
        Like trees reaching for light <br />
        Even in the heart of summer
      </p>,
      <p>
        I will rise not because I lack scars, But because I’ve endured them.{" "}

        Not because the storm has passed <br />

        The silence of mouth <br />
        Is the sound of mind <br />
        The silence of mind <br />
        Is the sound of soul <br />
        The silence of soul <br />
        Is the sound of existence <br />
        The silence of existence <br />
        Is the sound of nothingness <br />
        <i className="bi bi-circle-fill"></i>
      </p>,
      <p>
        Nothingness filled by existence <br />
        Which breeds the soul <br />
        Which breeds the mind <br />
        Which breeds the body <br />
        The body claims life <br />
        Through words of mouth <br />
        The mouth with which <br />
        Life cries, mumbles, murmurs <br />
        Words, speaks, orders <br />
        And gives breath <br />
        With silence comes the sound of death <br />
        <i className="bi bi-circle-fill"></i>
      </p>,
      <p>
        Be not silent, find the mouth, <br />
        To express the mind, and open the soul, <br />
        To acknowledge existence out of nothingness <br />
        <br />
        HOPE <br />
        Hope <br />
        To be seen To be heard <br />
        To be felt To be known <br />
        I hope to be <br />
        I hope <br />
        To be healed from all the pain <br />
        I hope from depression again <br />
      </p>,
      <p>
        <i className="bi bi-circle-fill"></i>
        You are hope <br />
        Maybe not whole <br />
        But enough <br />
        <i className="bi bi-circle-fill"></i>
      </p>,
      <p>
        In the end, I stand cos it’s quiet at the bottom <br />
        I look up cos I believe in hope <br />
        Remember in my low the echoes will guide me <br />
        Know when it’s slow the abyss is only getting less hollow <br />
        <span className="h4">CAN I RISE UP?</span>
