        One day, among the many options, silence will no longer be an option.
        Death will be because in reality we just have options that ends with
        dust to dust and the inhalation of our final breath in death always ends
        in regret for things that we find ourselves not doing.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Doing wetin? Doing fire! The fire that continually burns in our bosoms
        as we sit and watch, waiting for it to be extinguished.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Extinguished with what? The water and Garri that most of the the people
        in grassroots cannot afford? Cost of living wan kill the living and the
        air we breathe is toxic.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Optimism as a bitter pill to swallow suddenly feels like Drug abuse as
        we have bitten more than we can chew and with with anger and rage we
        choose to sorosoké on the streets crying out — Sirs, our sighs are loud
        enough if you will just hear them and there's blood on the flag.
      </p>,
      <p>Blood.</p>,
      <p>
        I can hear clearly the sounds of sirens and gunshots as we continually
        chant to ourselves that the labour of our heroes past shall never be in
        vain. These gunshot wounds are the proof that our pain is original.
      </p>,
      <p>
        In the heart of Lagos at the Lekki toll gate, where voices rose in unity
        to stand up for the injustice, bullets spilled our blood on your floors
        and you watched us. One shot, one move, Emeka don go, then Obus then na
        Tolani.
      </p>,
      <p>
        The chants and the cries of the blood wasted on the streets still rings
        in my head like a bell. These bloods cry louder than the voice of Abel
        and this pain tell us that these consequences are more brutal than what
        you have done.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Crime is our only Escapism to make you feel our pain and you push us
        into cages for being the monsters you made.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Divide and rule and you killed and conquered but no more would silence
        be our last resort.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I spit on your mornings in my shackles, my voice filled with rage in the
        cage you have made but I will no longer be filled with pain. These
        shards from the broken pieces my heart will continually pierce you till
        you make a change and Oh, we would hope like we have overdosed on that
        Faith pill until things get better.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Have you passed through the Lekki toll gate today? I bet you would find
        shards of glasses that was rammed into my chest continually and my
        spirit lurking somewhere around the corners, but this time around, maybe
        the year I turned 64, no matter how I sorosoké, you can't hear me.

        We've been through hell and back,
        <br />
        But look, we're standing tall. <br />
        Our sacks are filled with nothing at all, <br />
        Yet we sing songs as if we've had it all. <br />
        Better days ahead, they say, <br />
        Though we still wear the garments of yesterday.
      </p>,
      <p>
        The rivers flow with oil, yet thirst abounds, <br />
        We smile while our stomachs echo empty sounds. <br />
        A feast on the table for the few who dine, <br />
        While we savor the crumbs and call it fine.
      </p>,
      <p>
        The roads are long and winding still, <br />
        But we claim they lead to the promised hill. <br />
        Our leaders shine in their regal gold, <br />
        While we, the masses, are left out in the cold.
      </p>,
      <p>
        In the year we turned 64, <br />
        We cheered for progress, we asked for more. <br />
        With broken dreams and hearts that bled, <br />
        We hailed our heroes who long since fled.
      </p>,
      <p>
        In crowded streets, we march in line, <br />
        Seeking justice, grasping time. <br />
        With voices hoarse, we raise our cries, <br />
        But promises fade like sunset skies.
      </p>,
      <p>
        We hold the scars, yet still we dare, <br />
        To hope for change, to breathe fresh air. <br />
        For though we're bruised, we're far from done, <br />
        In our hearts, the fire still runs.

        Nigeria, a land flowing with milk and honey. <br />
        We gained freedom, yet still there is longing. <br />
        The labour of our heroes past, almost in vain. <br />
        Echoes of democracy washed down the drain.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Where the rich dine in their fine mansions, <br />
        The poor filling their stomach with crumbs. <br />
        Our leaders constantly making unfulfilled promises, <br />
        Living in luxury, off the sweat of the masses.
      </p>,
      <p>
        The economy broken down in shambles, <br />
        The hope of the masses crumbled, <br />
        Every sector slowly declining, <br />
        But still our hearts remain praying.
      </p>,
      <p>
        The blood of our young ones innocently shed, <br />
        In peaceful protests fueled by hunger and distress, <br />
        Our flag stained by injustice and corruption, <br />
        Coat of arms representing an unreal picture.
      </p>,
      <p>
        So in the year we turned 64, <br />
        Our weary hearts cling to our wavering dreams, <br />
        <br />
        That the Giant of Africa stands to her feet, <br />
        <br />
        That she becomes a beacon of light, standing for what is right <br />
        That she blooms in peace, serving a future bright. <br />
        One Niger Area, its people in pure delight.

        In borrowed light, we danced in chains, <br />
        Laughing through our quiet pains. <br />
        With empty hands, we reached for stars, <br />
        Behind golden gates, yet locked by bars.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Our leaders spoke in silent screams, <br />
        Selling our bright, forgotten dreams. <br />
        We bought them cheap, though deeply scarred, <br />
        Hoping for life where death was charred.
      </p>,
      <p>
        The barren fields held whispers sweet, <br />
        Of fruitful harvests, bound in deceit. <br />
        We plowed with hope, though seeds were none, <br />
        Fighting for shade beneath a sun.
      </p>,
      <p>
        In peaceful rage, we shook our fists, <br />
        Held close by lies we couldn't resist. <br />
        We wore the crowns of beggars bold, <br />
        Kings in rags, in stories told.
      </p>,
      <p>
        They raised the flag in colorless pride, <br />
        Shouting victory where losses hide. <br />
        And yet we cheered, with hearts of lead, <br />
        As silent words on papers bled.
      </p>,
      <p>
        So here we stand, though dreams lay torn, <br />
        In heavy light of hope reborn. <br />
        We walk through night, toward dawn's fierce shore, <br />
        The year we turned 64.

        The year we turned sixty four. <br />
        With anguish and pain we celebrated it. <br />
        Our eyes bled tears onto the mother earth. <br />
        Our foundation eaten deep by corruption and left shaking.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Into a new dawn and new age. <br />
        Majestically we walk into it with no hope for a better tomorrow. <br />
        Our faces shrouded with doubt and uncertainty.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Independent but still in captivity. <br />
        Bound by the chains of poverty and bad governance. <br />
        Driven into calamity by greedy beings.
      </p>,
      <p>
        In times like this, we can only hope for a better tomorrow. <br />
        The youths are the leaders of tomorrow. <br />
        But is it guaranteed?
      </p>,
      <p>
        The doubts are clearer as the future leaders themselves have been buried
        in the sins of their present. <br />
        We can only look up to God for total restoration. <br />
        For him to grant us the grace to turn 65 with brighter hope, better
        tomorrow and guaranteed stability.
