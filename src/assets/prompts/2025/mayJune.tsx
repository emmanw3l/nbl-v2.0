        I miss the days where I was young and free and didn’t have to worry
        about anything, where I had my friends all around me and fun right in
        front of me free to do anything within our confined space.

        Most would say we were say we were cut out from the outside world, but I
        didn’t see it like that, if anything it felt like we were being
        protected from the activities of the outside world, the world living in
        it’s own time and we in our bubble doing something different. Things
        were peaceful back then and less stressful, but then I grew up.

        This isn’t a prompt about a specific memory cause no matter how I try to
        remember, no particular happy memory stands out but rather this is more
        about a particular period of time when things were simpler.

        Boarding school was a bittersweet experience for me, but it was also
        some of the happiest moments of my life even till now. The days where
        I’d do noting but eat and build sandcastles then go on to play “police
        and thief” later in the evening, the days where we would take turns
        coming up with jokes trying to see who would make others laugh the most,
        the days when I’d go to bake bread just so I can get an extra helping
        when they share it the next day, all the treasure hunting games I ever
        played and even the obstacle courses we designed, the fun board games we
        curated and the stories we wrote and discarded, the spooky stories we’d
        bunker up to share and the impromptu races we had, the times we would
        run away from security chasing us, adrenaline making us ignore the risk
        involved if even one of us got caught, the times were I thought I had
        uncovered the activities of a secret cult and followed the breadcrumbs
        of clues right into a dead-end.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I miss the days when I pretended to be a stuntman, jumping off the roofs
        of buildings because of a dare, climbing up the same buildings when we
        kicked a ball to high up and it gets stuck, I miss the days when we
        remixed popular songs to fit with the boarding school lifestyle, I miss
        the days when we ran to the dining hall and the first to reach gets to
        eat more than the rest, I miss so many things about the school but sadly
        I grew up – can’t be in secondary school forever.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I know I’m technically not old yet, after all, I’m only 21, but still,
        the memory of a time when things were simpler makes me feel like it’s
        been a lifetime ago I experienced these events even though it’s only
        been 13 years, then again 13 years is more than half the time I’ve been
        alive, so maybe these events really were a lifetime ago.

        I was taking a stroll down to Iya Risikiyat’s shop to buy a recharge
        card. It was a very sunny and bright day. The cheerful cries and screams
        of children playing “Boju Boju” and “Catcher Catcher” brought back
        memories of my childhood.
      </p>,
      <p>
        One particular Saturday stands out in my mind. I must have been around 8
        years old. My siblings and I spent the day exploring the whole street,
        playing with pebbles on the road, and shouting at any white bird,
        “Lekeleke, give me white fingers!” or screaming, “Aeroplane, come and
        carry me!” The smell of ripe mangoes, the sun on our skin, and the
        freedom that came with fewer responsibilities were exhilarating.
      </p>,
      <p>
        We’d gather with other children in the street to play games. We’d play
        “Catcher Catcher” and run around, screaming and avoiding being caught
        until it felt like our hearts would stop. We’d roll tires with our
        oversized pants dragging along behind us on our knees, with catarrh
        pooling in our noses and dropping. Afterwards, we’d switch to “Boju
        Boju” wondering where that infinite energy’s came from and hide in the
        weirdest places – like getting stuck in a bucket! Dripping with sweat
        and covered in sand, we’d eventually gather round after being disrupted
        by the sound of our mother’s voice calling us.
      </p>,
      <p>
        As we’d rush into the house with dirty bodies, pull off our clothes, and
        do a quick dash to the backyard to take a bath, the cool water would
        wash away the dirt and grime, refreshing us for the next adventure.
        Then, we’d gather around the dinner table, sharing stories of our
        adventures and laughter echoing through the night. We’d munch on
        Grandma’s homemade food – her Jollof rice and dodo were favorites among
        us. The meals were more than just food; they were a celebration of
        family, love, and togetherness, resulting in childhood memories full of
        bliss and joy.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Those carefree days were filled with laughter, excitement, and a sense
        of freedom that only childhood can bring. As I look back, I realize that
        those moments shaped me into the person I am today – someone who values
        family, cherishes simplicity, and finds joy in the little things. The
        memories of those sunny days, playing with friends, and sharing meals
        with loved ones will forever be etched in my mind, a reminder of the
        beauty and wonder of childhood.

        I came across a path in life where I lacked direction on the next step.
        Sometimes, I hold on to the past and the memories it brings. Other
        times, I want to leave everything behind and move forward to the next.
        The past reminds me of how I once lived, a book I can never go back to
        rewrite, a clock I can’t turn back. But the future is unknown, and that
        scares me more. The memories it holds are a mystery to my knowledge, and
        the pressure for it to be better than the present rests heavily on my
        shoulders.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I drive down memory lane to the past and revisit my childhood days. The
        days when I look forward to my daily meals and friends to play with,
        sleeping with so much fatigue when the night falls. It does not have the
        best days, but it is never worse than the period of independence where
        the *_pressure is getting worserrr._* Life is so rosy when you are a
        child. Your only job is to live. Your basic needs are provided for by
        the ones who birthed you. From here, your well-being, apart from
        physical and financial aspects, gets forgotten.
      </p>,
      <p>
        My early days were filled with struggles. It was more of being a
        snail—hiding in my shell away from things I don’t fit into and showing
        my face as I take it slow to find my balance and identity. Most nights,
        people discovered their solace but the night birthed questions I had no
        answers to. Why am I different? Why don’t I fit in? What is wrong with
        me? When will I be free? Every peer shared a similarity in hobbies or
        leisure interests while I struggled in the background to find a
        connection with a single soul.
      </p>,
      <p>
        As I grew, there were moments of love interest, friends finding their
        intimate connection. At the same time, I strive in solitude, savoring
        what I perceive as inner peace in my corners, away from what is
        disguised as iniquities before my eyes. Everything was tough, and life
        didn’t seem to produce any meaning. My existence was in doubt, and my
        purpose was without hope. How could I picture things getting better from
        where I was when the present felt it was without form or void?
      </p>,
      <p>
        My daily worry was freedom. I felt held back from living without
        constructed restrictions. I needed to be without fear and live without
        whispers of judgment. I wanted to be wild with zero regrets about every
        experience. I longed to do the things I chose, whether I had eyes on me
        or not. I needed to be sure I was doing nothing wrong. After all, I was
        young.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Maybe this was me moving away from decency or moral standards groomed
        from the womb, but it was so much more. I needed to find myself and know
        what I was made for. These were the journeys that made up my childhood.
        They are not my favorite memories, but they can never be uncovered.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Despite the challenges I encountered, the future I worried about seemed
        filled with accomplishments and work I thought I couldn’t do. Where I go
        from here remains a secret I may or may not fear once I discover it.

        <span className="bold">Back when I was a child,</span> things were
        easier. Life was easier.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I would stare at the four walls of my comfort, of my bliss and haven and
        smile and run all day to God knows where. I would come back dirty with a
        mischievous smile and would be scolded before being patted down, and I
        would nod promising not to do it again while plotting my next escape the
        following day.
      </p>,
      <p>
        When I was a child, I never cared if there were no sweets in the store
        or if there was no money to buy them. All I wanted was to have one, or
        maybe two, no matter what. When I was a child, yes was yes, no was no. I
        never had to mince words or beat around the bush before saying anything.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Back when I was a child, I didn't understand anything that was going on
        that seemed to be so complex and complicated and just went about my day
        in spite of other _older_ people's sad faces. I couldn't understand so I
        couldn't relate or feel the pain with them.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Back when I was a child, I cared about nothing more than my family, my
        home, food and my next mischief. There was nothing like thinking about
        assignments, somebody that did something to me, over-understanding and
        overthinking, working so hard, avoiding risks, putting my heart out
        there.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Back when I was a child, if I was told I wouldn't get something, I would
        cry and cry and beg or worse throw tantrums. There was nothing like
        pride. Point is, I don't even need to ask now. If I wasn't going to get
        something, I knew and I would rather remain silent.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Back when I was a child, I told everyone everything. Who I like, who I
        didn't like, what injured my toe, how my day went, what I want, how I
        want it, when I want it. I told everyone how I felt, I'll cry when I
        wanted to cry and smile when I wanted to cry. There was nothing like
        making a division of what to cry about and what not to cry about. There
        was nothing like wearing a mask, keeping it in, holding on, being
        strong.
      </p>,
      <p>
        One will realize faintly and clearer someday what it felt to be like
        that. To cry at anything and everything. Now, sometimes you forget to
        cry. Even if the tears come, you hold it in. And one day a fragile rope
        that was holding it all cut and it all bursts out and you wonder where
        all the tears had been all along.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Back when I was a child, I wanted to be older. I wanted to be able to do
        'adult' things. I wanted to do things that I want to do but were not
        supposed to be for people of my age.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Which brings me to ask, was it the innocence? Or freedom and bliss of
        being ignorant? If we were told how overwhelming growing up will be,
        would we have even understood? It seems as though it is a necessity to
        go through it all, the whole process of growing up.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Back when I was a child, I never knew I would grow up and miss the bliss
        of childhood. The happiness that comes with it, and the memories that
        makes me wonder, why all I did made sense to me then and laugh it all
        out because I was a child.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I never knew I would grow up and learn, be knowledgeable and still
        continue to learn because it never stops.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Back when I was a child, I never knew I would be who I am today. A
        little bit smarter, a little bit wiser, a little bit taller, a little
        bit busier, a little bit stronger, a little bit tired, a little bit
        older, less happier.

        The skies were bluer <br />
        Night time darker <br />
        But the moon and the stars smiled brighter <br />
        The clouds moved to the form of something greater <br />
        An unseen sculptor <br />
        With a kingdom of bronze.... <br />
        Or was it gold <br />
        Depending on how he felt it was either a sunny warmth or a stormy cold{" "}
        <br />
        Or maybe both <br />
        Then when I was told <br />
        If it was both then a lion—or was it an elephant <br />
        Was in great labor pangs, giving life to it's infant <br />
        I loved looking up <br />
        I always got lost <br />
        I loved it, I was buried in thoughts <br />
        Drowning in rushes and whirlpools of my wanderlust
      </p>,
      <p>
        Some days I'd ride in the breath of my curtains <br />
        They breathed wildly <br />
        Flaring to the storm's rhythm <br />
        I would stay in it "controlling" the "waves" of the storm with my
        siblings <br />
        Feeling the exhilarating wind on our skins <br />
        In the cold rain, warming ourselves with smiles gleaming <br />
        We were more than pirates <br />
        We were a greater power's favourites <br />
        The world was ours to conquer
      </p>,
      <p>
        When we didn't have to behave and put things right for mother <br />
        When we were younger <br />
        We were actors, we were doctors, we were soldiers, we were fighters, we
        were characters, we were lovers, we were explorers <br />
        Hopping on rocks and over boulders of couches, chairs, tables, and throw
        pillows avoiding the "lava" <br />
        Being there and helping one another
      </p>,
      <p>
        When I was a child <br />
        I would go on great rides <br />
        From the parlor to the room, then the dangerous stairs <br />
        But we were never scared <br />
        We would go at it for hours <br />
        The world was ours <br />
        And we took it by it's reins <br />
        In the little playground we made <br />
        It was every corner of our house and space <br />
        Beneath our stairs, we had hunted journeys in caves <br />
        "Gun" wars, and for light we would chant prayers <br />
        And when there was light we would sing like town criers <br />
        Praises to our Father above and the station we loved <br />
        The only time we mostly stayed still—untroubled <br />
        When we weren't riled or bothered <br />
        We had powers <br />
        Because the world was ours
      </p>,
      <p>
        When I was a child <br />
        Nothing much was on my mind <br />
        Except playing, having fun, watching TV, wanting to know more, and
        reading <br />
        From novels, compilation of stories, and gory newspaper stories, I had a
        thing for books with stories <br />
        I stayed serenaded in the whistles of the wind <br />
        The chimes of the trees <br />
        The singing of the birds <br />
        Most mornings, their choruses kept me in bed <br />
        I hoped the world revolved around me <br />
        When it showed it didn't I didn't know how to feel <br />
        I was more furious and loved creating <br />
        My curious mind remained curious still, as I couldn't yet know
        everything <br />
        I was still a child but older <br />
        I was more bitter with a tinge of sweet, my chest became fuller <br />
        I grew taller, my shoulders became broader <br />
        Maybe all the things I began to shoulder <br />
        The world wasn't mine, it drew lines <br />
        But I had plans to take on mines and make it mine <br />
        And even though I'm older <br />
        I'm still a child to my father and mother
