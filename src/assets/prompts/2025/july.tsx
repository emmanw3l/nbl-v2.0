        I used to think it was two different voices but I realised it’s just one
        voice inside of me, operating in different conditions.
      </p>,
      <p>It’s lifted me up, it’s brought me down to my worst.</p>,
      <p>On good days, I hear the silent whispers that reassure me.</p>,
      <p>
        On bad days, I hear the Loud roars that tell me I’m not good enough.
      </p>,
      <p>
        The voice inside is a force, that stills and troubles. <br />
        It’s a shield in solemn whispers protecting me from doubt and
        uncertainties. <br />
        It’s a weapon that fights for my survival and conquests. <br />
        It’s a mirror that searches my deepest desires and reflects my longing.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Some days it’s kind. Other days, it pierces through my heart.
        <br />
        But it’s my voice. One voice. <br />
        I’m learning to own it, to lead it and channel it the right direction.{" "}
        <br />
        It's my voice and I'm becoming the boss of it.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I’m learning to protect my voice from the harsh realities of the outside
        world so it doesn’t harm me. Because truly, my voice was never the
        problem. It’s not bad or good. It’s simply a manifestation of what I put
        into my mind.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Now I’m choosing carefully what goes into my mic and amplifying my voice
        in ways that empowers me.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I want my voice to always be a friend, my strength source, and a
        constant reminder of who I am.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I’m not searching for my voice anymore because it’s in who I am. <br />
        It’s bold, kind and real.

        “Are you still with us?” My friend, Roy, waved his hand in my face as I
        zoned out yet again. I blinked, caught off-guard then offered a sheepish
        smile.
      </p>,
      <p>"Yeah...sorry."</p>,
      <p>
        “What are you thinking about. Your husband and kids?” My best friend,
        Kerzia, teased and from the corner of my eyes, I noticed Roy’s
        expression changed. But only for a second.
      </p>,
      <p>
        He likes to pretend he’s nonchalant but he’s very easy to read. That
        flicker in his eyes? It’s possessiveness. I always pretend not to notice
        for fun.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I laughed at my best friend’s statement and shrugged my shoulders. Today
        was supposed to be a day for the three of us to have fun, not to talk
        about my depressing situation at home.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I’m in my head a lot, I try to distract myself from the things happening
        at home but it’s kind of hard to when it always happens right in front
        of you. I dread going back home after classes, I dread going to bed at
        night because it has become a nightly ritual to argue late at night.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I read somewhere that manifesting positivity is good. I speak positive
        words to myself, as I walk, as I clean, as I work, as I am about to
        sleep. I tell myself I am strong and everything is going to be okay. If
        you let your mind control you, you’re very likely to go insane. No
        kidding.
      </p>,
      <p>
        “You sure you’re good?” Roy asked me, quieter this time. His eyes
        lingered on me a second too long.
      </p>,
      <p>“100% let’s go get pizza, I’m hungry.”</p>,
      <p>He didn’t look convinced. But thankfully, he didn’t press.</p>,

        There’s a door <br />
        Third creak past sleep, left of silence <br />
        Where my mind lives in unfinished sentences.
      </p>,
      <p>
        No storm, no symphony, <br />
        Just… clarity. <br />
        Stillness, not stagnation. <br />
        A compass not spinning, <br />
        But fixed. <br />
        Always north.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I do not bleed thoughts. <br />
        They don’t scream, <br />
        They whisper blueprints. <br />
        Not chaos, <br />
        But construction
      </p>,
      <p>
        I wonder <br />
        Is this lack of torment a form of numbness <br />
        Or a reward for discipline? <br />
        They say minds are mazes. <br />
        Mine is a corridor.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I’ve seen minds splinter, <br />
        Chasing ghosts they made. <br />
        But mine? <br />
        It sits at a roundtable, <br />
        Arguing only with shadows <br />
        That don’t pass my gate <br />
        Unless I permit.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Yes <br />
        Darkness knocks. <br />
        But I… filter
      </p>,
      <p>
        Selfishness arrives dressed in logic. <br />
        Temptation wears perfume. <br />
        But morality is louder than scent
      </p>,
      <p>
        And yet, <br />
        I feel one thing clawing in, <br />
        Time <br />
        The future. <br />
        It hums in a pitch no silence can mute. <br />
        That’s my only ache <br />
        The not knowing when <br />
        But I don’t break, <br />I build.
      </p>,
      <p>
        You see, <br />
        My mind is a gardener, <br />
        It weeds envy, <br />
        Plants ambition, <br />
        Waters purpose. <br />
        And somehow, those who walk beside me <br />
        Bloom too. <br />
        Not because I lead them, <br />
        But because I believe they can lead themselves.
      </p>,
      <p>
        So no <br />
        This mind doesn’t spiral. <br />
        It climbs. <br />
        Me, myself, and the staircase in my skull, <br />
        Walking straight even when the world bends

        In my head, they run freely <br />
        A continuous circle of unending chaos <br />
        The voices—constantly echoing inside of my head <br />
        Sometimes they come in gentle whispers like a fairy’s <br />
        Other times they come in loud waves like the ocean’s roar <br />I wonder
        if the voices are a part of me or nature’s not-so-subtle way of telling
        me I’m insufficient
      </p>,
      <p>
        They come at dawn, when the world is still <br />
        Whispers of what I could’ve been, of what’s been lost <br />
        They come at dusk, when shadows loom <br />
        Echoes of my fears, of doubts that consume
      </p>,
      <p>
        In the stillness, I try to listen <br />
        To the quiet voice that whispers “you’re enough” <br />
        But the negative roars drowns it out <br />A chorus of criticism, of
        judgment, of shame
      </p>,
      <p>
        The voices tell me I’m not good enough <br />
        That I’ll never be loved, that I’m not worthy <br />
        They tell me to give up, to hide away <br />
        To silence the noise, to numb the pain
      </p>,
      <p>
        But I try to hold on to hope <br />
        To the fragile thread of resilience <br />
        I try to find solace in the gentle whispers <br />
        To calm the storm that rages within my soul
      </p>,
      <p>
        They’re a reflection of my deepest fears <br />
        A manifestation of my darkest doubts <br />
        Most times, I feel like I’m losing control <br />
        Like the voices are taking over, like I’m drowning
      </p>,
      <p>
        In the sea of self-doubt, I’m adrift <br />
        Clinging to the wreckage of my shattered dreams and hopes
      </p>,
      <p>
        The voices are a constant companion <br />
        A shadow that follows me, wherever I go <br />
        They’re a reminder of my flaws, my mistakes <br />A nagging sense of
        inadequacy that refuses to fade
      </p>,
      <p>
        I try to silence them, to quiet the noise <br />
        But they persist, a relentless drumbeat <br />
        A reminder that I’m not whole, not complete <br />
        That I’m broken, flawed, and imperfect
      </p>,
      <p>
        In the darkness, I search for a light <br />
        A glimmer of hope, a beacon in the night <br />
        I try to find solace in the gentle whispers <br />
        To calm the storm that rages within
      </p>,
      <p>
        But then I have come to the realization that the voices will always be
        there <br />
        A constant nagging feeling of self hate coursing through me <br />
        The only thing is to silence the voices coming from within <br />
        But what happens when I can’t?

        “What if they don’t like you?”, “You might not be good enough for them,
        yunno”, Doubt and negativity whisper, wrapping their hands around my
        mind.
      </p>,
      <p>
        My mind knows no peace. It has become a raging storm, a cradle of
        thoughts; good, bad and weird ones. Each thought is living, loud,
        chaotic, persuasive. My mind is a hallway with so many doors. Loud
        whispers, echoes and confusing voices lie await behind everyone of those
        doors.
      </p>,
      <p>
        It’s a continuous battle I fight daily. I try not to open them up, but
        somehow, I still hear a creak in the dark. Curiosity grips me each time,
        I lose control, I pause to listen.
      </p>,
      <p>
        “Even though you’re a bad person, at least you’re way better than
        Chidinma. That girl sucks. She stinks. She can’t even speak good English
        to cover up for the beauty she lacks.” I giggle for a few seconds and
        feel guilty afterwards.
      </p>,
      <p>
        “Next time you see Michael, throw something at him. Anything!! Even if
        it’s a stone. Even if he dies. He’s too annoying. You’ll run away. Mom
        will shield you and ship you out of this country.”
      </p>,
      <p>
        It’s bedtime. I try massaging the carrot miracle oil into my face with
        my palms. “Blood is nasty though,” A door creak open, the voice emerging
        out of it sarcastic.
      </p>,
      <p>
        “Are you sure no one laughed?”, “Someone probably knows about it”. I
        immediately slam the door of the reminders that my secrets might be
        known and laid bare to the whole world. No. I can’t stand you tonight,
        not tonight. I told nobody, so there’s no way anybody would know that I
        was the one who stole it.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I jump into my bed. Covering myself with my wrapper, I mutter some
        prayers and made a sign of the cross. “You’re funny, so that’s all the
        prayer you’re going to do for the night?”, “What happened to the book of
        Proverbs you said you’d start today?”
      </p>,
      <p>
        I hiss quietly and pick up my phone from my bedside drawer. I’m tired,
        please. I stare at my lock screen wallpaper, a beautiful picture of me,
        my mom and my late dad.
      </p>,
      <p>
        “Maybe the reason you no longer have feelings for men is because you
        were raped!” This voice, unlike the others, is slow and still, yet
        fierce. I agree with what it says. “Men are evil beings. Anybody who
        likes men obviously has not gone through what you’ve gone through”. I
        love this one. I walk in.
      </p>,
      <p>
        “Yunno, you can mess guys up. The same way your dad messed you up.
        You’re smart enough”. I hit my palms against my face. I’m finished. What
        are these things I think about??
      </p>,
      <p>
        That’s not me. I cannot become evil because I was treated badly. That
        was years ago. “Yes, you’ve forgiven and forgotten”, I hear another
        voice whisper.
      </p>,
      <p>
        “Or not. You’ve probably just buried it deep down. It’s still there if
        you check”. I get up from my bed. Get behind me Satan. I have forgiven
        my dad.
      </p>,
      <p>
        “I’m not Satan, I’m your thoughts.” Nooo. I can’t be all of these
        voices. Where’s the real me? Let me think straight. I want to think
        straight, pleaseeeee.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I shut my eyes, slowly drifting off to sleep. “You’ve always been the
        reason for all your failed friendships. You know you’re a bad friend,
        right?” Yes, I know. Does it even matter what I am?
      </p>,
      <p>
        I try to fall asleep, but then I realize that I am only trying so hard
        to avoid the fact that slowly, I’m becoming a product of my thoughts. A
        head spinning in confusion. A lady in distress one day and the next, at
        peace.
      </p>,
      <p>
        If I, my actions and my words are a product of my thoughts, then do I
        own myself? Where have I gone wrong? How did I let these thoughts form?
        What have I let in? What control do I have of myself? My mind now rules
        me, so from tomorrow, I’ll have to guard its doors better. But for now,
        I’ll suppress and allow till I fall asleep.
