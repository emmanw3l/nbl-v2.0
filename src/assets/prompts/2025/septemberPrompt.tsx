        Hi <br />
        If only you would reply. <br />
        Let me know I am doing too much let me know this break has gone on long
        enough, let me know something… <br />
        But you won’t respond.
      </p>,
      <p>
        We are on break <br />
        But why am I breaking with each passing day? I am breaking down,
        breaking things, breaking because no one is looking or cares to look
        anyway.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I’m not built for hesitation, not for negation, and definitely not one
        to regret my actions. Maybe I am no good maybe I needed this break more
        than I am letting on.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I want to be in your scream, in your dreams, in the books you read but
        that would only break you forgetting it is breaking me too. I am
        supposed to be on break but here I am persistently writing my third book
        as the indie author you were once proud of.
      </p>,
      <p>
        If only that would be enough for me to launch the book. To make it 3
        books in a year that I have launched consecutively but that would be
        record-breaking.
      </p>,
      <p>And I am not allowed to break that.</p>,

        August was an interesting time. It opened me to parts of the world I
        didn't know existed.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I was on an internship program. I worked with Environmental Health
        Officers whose job was to inspect restaurants, hotels or small scale
        food vendors who had hazardous environments and fine them or shut down
        the place completely.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I didn't quite know what to expect, but I was appalled by how casual the
        people were in places with a catastrophic level of filthiness.
      </p>,
      <p>
        A particular incident stood out in a particular bakery I went to. One of
        the workers packaging bread scratched his{" "}
        <span className="italics">manhood</span> and continued touching and
        packaging loaves, without washing his hands. He tried to be discreet but
        was unfortunately caught by me and other interns. Not wanting to call
        him out openly, I simply mentioned to the manager to emphasize the
        importance of hand washing among her employees. He knew I was talking
        about him, which was why he sent a furious glare my way. One of my
        colleagues glared back until he looked away. My colleague snorted, “he's
        angry because you told him to wash his hands. The hand wey dey smell.”
        It was a funny exchange to watch.
      </p>,
      <p>
        In another incident, we went to a hotel where weeds and algae grew
        unchecked, and waste was dumped indiscriminately. The place seemed like
        it was managed by someone who probably slept till noon every day.
      </p>,
      <p>
        The Environmental Health Officers (EHOs) had fined the hotel heavily and
        educated the cooks on food safety. They nodded and smiled sweetly, but I
        doubt they truly changed.
      </p>,
      <p>
        We went to small food scale vendors dwelling in slums. I felt a great
        deal of sympathy for the cooks even as I was vexed by their food
        preparations. I knew they were careless with food because that was what
        was taught to them. Perhaps if food establishments made cooking staff
        undergo regular food safety training, their minds would shift in such a
        way they completely abhor filthiness.
      </p>,
      <p className="marquee">MISSING PARAGRAPH</p>,
      // <p>
      //     When I was not at work, I was reading _Battlefield Of The Mind_ by Joyce Meyer, watching _Just Us Girls_ on YouTube or simply being present with the people I love. In a nutshell, August was fun and informative.

      <p>
        I kept telling myself, <br />
        I don’t need a break. <br />
        Poems already chase me like stubborn children, <br />
        pulling at my sleeve in crowded buses, <br />
        scribbled on receipts, <br />
        waking me at three a.m. with no apology. <br />
        Why would I pause from that?
      </p>,
      <p>
        But life has its own stubbornness. <br />
        One day, it pulled the plug on all my noise, <br />
        left me with a silence I didn’t ask for. <br />
        I sulked. <br />
        Folded shirts I didn’t plan to wear, <br />
        lined up pens like they were soldiers ready for war, <br />
        pretended I was still busy. <br />
        “I don’t need it,” I muttered, <br />
        Like repeating it could make it true.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Then the small things began to talk. <br />
        a mango softening too quickly on the table, <br />
        the neighbor’s dog matching my footsteps, <br />
        dust freckles on the ceiling <br />
        teaching me slow patience. <br />
        The pause wasn’t telling me to stop writing; it was teaching me how to
        listen with both ears open.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Breaks don’t always heal. <br />
        Sometimes they uncover what you’d rather hide. <br />
        I thought I was running strong, <br />
        But the quiet showed me the limp I’d been dragging. <br />
        I thought silence was empty, <br />
        but it carried its own rhythm, <br />
        its own grammar, <br />
        its own strange kind of prophecy.
      </p>,
      <p>
        So no, the break didn’t fix me. <br />
        But it carved out a small space inside. <br />
        In that space, I placed a pebble of patience, <br />
        a pocket of joy I had walked past too often, <br />
        and a bruise, <br />
        The gentle proof that even strength <br />
        sometimes has to sit down.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I still tell myself I didn’t need the break. <br />
        But the truth is simple: <br />
        The break needed me.

      <p>
        There were moments where my mind could picture a thousand beginnings and
        determine how every end would be. Every story starting in my mind walked
        in different genres, every sentence building the next anticipated scene,
        and every character being the star in their own world, whether good or
        evil. Those days reminded me of what I lived for: to be a creative
        genius, to let my art speak my truth, and to let my work attract my
        audience, people who were meant for me. The fire in me was ever burning,
        and my spark never died. Who knew there would come a day when life would
        press pause on me?
      </p>,
      <p>
        The evil days came. Days where I spent hours in my space staring at a
        blank page while the cursor blinked at me, what I saw as a cry for help
        or a side-eye to taunt me. The once free words felt imprisoned. The flow
        I once had suddenly seemed like there were behind bars, a barrier I
        tried to overcome. All my attempts to extract ideas came across as weak,
        likely to collapse. It had no substance and was unworthy of being
        recorded.
      </p>,
      <p>
        It wasn’t about me at that point; it was about the craft that once made
        blank pages feel like home. It was more than just words; they were
        voices I once carried through my pen. The fire I once felt from within
        became another one that bit the dust, a dark smoke floating to the
        clouds. Consistency became a burden, and my badge of honour turned to a
        stain of disappointment. I told myself day after day to open my laptop
        or pick up a pen, but the weight of my silence held me back.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Perhaps there was some good in my silence. It didn’t come to me that I
        needed a break that started as a pause I never planned for. Life had a
        way of giving me different versions of what I never envisioned. First, I
        felt as if my words, pages, and flow were being taken away from me, or
        we drifted apart, but with time, my attention changed, something I
        became aware of. The silence I thought made me feel empty created space.
      </p>,
      <p>
        A time off was what I decided to take. It was not the one I thought it
        would be, but the kind that came to me. My academics, for starters,
        benefited from my time and attention. Putting writing aside gave me
        space to concentrate, study, and put myself into my books the way I used
        to put myself into sentences. My inability to express my thoughts with
        my creative process was channelled into wrapping up projects, meeting
        deadlines, and concluding an academic calendar. A curse I thought was
        sponsored by silence had turned out to be a disguised gift.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Here I am now, on the other side, I feel prepared to pick up a pen
        again, not just to study but to turn my ideas into words, breathing life
        into my sentences. My vision is clearer, I have more strength, and a
        stronger sense of purpose as a result of the break. My return to my art
        comes with a greater purpose, not just to write, but to inspire,
        develop, and create to my best capacity.
      </p>,
      <p>
        The break I never thought I needed has turned into the cornerstone of
        who I will become as the one who holds the pen.

        My usual ringtone of complaints usually rang along the lines of “I’m
        tired,” “I’m not feeling the writing,” “writer’s block,” blah blah blah.
        Suddenly, Bema’s message popped in: “There was going to be an August
        break for us. Apparently, an August break wasn’t only applicable to
        seasons anymore, was it?”
      </p>,
      <p>
        “At last, rest and relaxation,” I thought to myself. For a whole month,
        I was free from having to squeeze out creative juices for the month’s
        prompt.
      </p>,
      <p>
        For the first week, I relished the feeling of endless scrolling through
        reels on Instagram, coupled with the fact that the holidays were
        ongoing. The subsequent weeks followed the same pattern until it no
        longer felt exciting. The break was there, but I began to wonder if this
        was what I needed right now.
      </p>,
      <p>Did I really want this?</p>,
      <p>
        With or without the break, the source of my creativity seemed to be
        dried up these days, and I promised myself that I would use this break
        to regain what was lost.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Imagine my shock when, about a week before the end of the break, I was
        still feeling the same way.
      </p>,
      <p>Dried up, drained, and without the creativity I longed for!</p>,
      <p>
        I began focusing all my energy on rejuvenating my sources, reminiscent
        of the time when holding a pen equaled millions of prompt ideas running
        through my head. I was adamant about regaining my writing vigor. I read
        books that would help with that and did everything humanly possible,
        even taking naps to relax my mind.
      </p>,
      <p>
        However, I realized that I was still draining myself during the break I
        was meant to be relaxing.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Deciding to let go and allow the break to function as it was meant to, I
        felt like I was giving up, but I just wanted nature to take its course.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Little did I know that the break was not to rejuvenate my creative
        juices but my spiritual life. The break I never thought I needed was for
        my spiritual life, not my creative world.
      </p>,
      <p>
        The break was to prevent me from draining myself and to focus my energy
        on my dormant spiritual life, building my connection and relationship
        with God. Sometimes, your plan isn’t the actual plan. Man proposes, God
        disposes!
      </p>,
      <p>
        As of now, I’m happy to announce that my relationship with God has
        improved. We are currently in talking stage and somehow I feel He would
        ask me out very soon and I would happily agree and we would forever be
        in a happy and strong relationship.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Sometimes, what you want isn’t what you need, and often, your needs pave
        the way for you to access your wants with ease!

        NBL took a break in August. I was mildly relieved but ever progressing.{" "}
        <br />
        I took the time to reflect, ponder and dream on the past present and
        future of my writing journey.
        <br /> Though the break was meant to be a period for relaxation, I found
        comfort in doing what i loved most. Writing.

        WRITING THE POET <br />
        I reflected... <br />
        ● <br />
        To be a writer <br />
        Is to be the most open <br />

        Whilst closing all else
      </p>,
      <p>
        ● <br />

      </p>,
      <p>
        ● <br />
        To be a writer <br />
        Is to map your way to the reader <br />
        Through their thoughts into their hearts <br />
        Never meeting, but forever linked
      </p>,
      <p>
        ● <br />
        To be a writer <br />
        Is to be the readers’ reality <br />
        In a tale of ink and words <br />
        Fictioned artfully
      </p>,
      <p>
        ● <br />
        To be a writer <br />
        Is to write <br />
        And write and write <br />
        Unending closure <br />●
      </p>,
      <p>
        THE CHARACTERS WE WRITE <br />
        I pondered... <br />
        ● <br />
        The characters we write <br />
        They dance. They sing <br />
        They taunt. They cheer <br />
        The characters we write <br />
        In through reality’s keyhole, they peer <br />
        Before imaginative birth <br />
        They were all around us <br />
        Sometimes... Mostly in us <br />
        They were our thoughts, our voice <br />
        The people we loved and hated and missed <br />
        Our characters <br />
        Our gifts to readers <br />
        Our brain child’s <br />
        Delirium of perfect beings <br />
        Crafted from bits and pieces <br />
        Fitting in place and time <br />
        In the stories we write <br />●
      </p>,
      <p>
        MEMORIES PASSING TIME <br />
        I dreamt... <br />
        ● <br />
        Spent my days <br />
        Wandering Neverland <br />
        Now, all that’s changed <br />
        Ever since I passed the island
      </p>,
      <p>
        ● <br />
        My time as a lad <br />
        I’d dream far past noon <br />
        Over yonder till daybreak <br />
        And all through dusk again

        "I might just run away. I don't think I can face tomorrow." That was how
        I began a month I thought would be my month of restoration.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I believed so much in a month than in the giver of life. I boasted in
        August like never before. I told all my friends. I yapped like an
        American toddler. That was not Nigerian of me.
      </p>,
      <p>
        "August has always been a good month for me. Even when things are not
        working well, August just comes and changes the story. Omorrr, I can't
        wait."
      </p>,
      <p>Dear reader, quote on quote.</p>,
      <p>
        August did come. It saw me, and I saw it. Now, I see it differently.
        August walked into my life with a smirk, and I foolishly thought it came
        with gifts.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Every day in August, I sat back and watched my life, as though it was
        not mine.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I would sing, <br />
        "Because He lives, I can face tomorrow <br />
        Because He lives, All fear is gone <br />
        Because I know He holds my future, <br />
        And life is worth the living, <br />
        Just because He lives!" <br />
        To console myself. It was a lullaby, I guess.
      </p>,
      <p>
        And then once in a while, I would hear the words of the one person I had
        told my heart to, still ringing in my spirit. "Grace, you're strong in
        the Lord... LIVE!!!"
      </p>,
      <p>
        One minute, I would tell myself I was in a funny dream, and the next, I
        would realize that dreams are realities.
      </p>,
      <p>
        "You can live, you can face tomorrow" were all the words I needed to
        stay sane in August. Just those words.
      </p>,
      <p>
        It hit me really hard sometimes. I had so many questions. I was a
        walking corpse. I never prepared for that. I never saw it coming.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I waited on Yeshua. I waited, and I waited for my lover. I cried, till I
        wept. I closed my eyes, hoping I would open them to see a miracle
        staring right back at me. Everyday I took overdue naps, hoping I could
        escape from all of the pain, and wake up to a new life.
      </p>,
      <p>
        And do you know? Or did I forget to say it? I showed up like never
        before in August. I was everywhere. Speaking in Programs, advising
        people, building communities, raising funds for a sponsorship, teaching
        in church, playing leadership roles so well, doing business so well.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Yet, I watched myself sink. I asked, "What if?", "Where do I go from
        here?", "Couldn't it have turned out better?", "Who would help me?"
      </p>,
      <p>
        With every move, with every step, the heaviness of my heart dragged me
        like an invisible chain. Everything seemed stuck. I tried. I cried. I
        screamed, but no sound escaped.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I had so many questions unvoiced, so many weights, so many loads. <br />
        Everything seemed paused. Yet, the world seemed to be moving so fast,
        and there I was–STUCK.
      </p>,
      <p>
        For a moment, I forgot I was doing a lot and showing up before the
        world. It didn't matter anymore when I knew I was breaking and tearing
        into insignificant bits.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Each time I soaked my pillow with tears, I thought I heard a whisper, "I
        am more than this moment."
      </p>,
      <p>
        I don't know how. I don't know when. <br />
        But as the month began to draw to a close, I just knew things would get
        better. I was glad I didn't take my life.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I was glad I was sinking, yet still thinking forward. Even when I
        couldn't feel tomorrow, or the next minute.
      </p>,
      <p>
        I had my fight song. I had a motto. The words of a loved one, "Grace,
        you're strong in the Lord... LIVE!!!"
      </p>,
      <p>
        See me now. With a big lesson. I thought restoration and peace was tied
        to a month, but God was teaching me that everything is tied to Him. He
        stripped me off my illusions and taught me that my strength is not in a
        month, but in the One who holds my future.
      </p>,
      <p>
        That break was a painful class, a purposeful one.This is now a part of
        my testimony. I spent my break bearing my burden alone, learning lessons
        I did not understand then, and amassing strength.
      </p>,
      <p>
        God was making something out of me. I became stronger and better. When I
        lost faith and trials shaded me, I didn't struggle with faith, I lived!
        I hung onto things that seemed little, but mattered so much in that
        moment. A song and a sentence from God through a loved one.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Looking back now, I realize August was the break I never thought I
        needed. Now I know that I don't have to run. And today, I can say with
        all certainty: tomorrow is worth facing, not because August promised me,
        but because He lives.

        To be honest, writing has been feeling like a burden as of late, <br />
Ideas that once flowed freely have been starting to stagnate, <br />
Creativity, out of my pores it evaporates, <br />
For if I can’t paint a scenario am I even a poet?

    </p>,
    <p>
        And I could make silly excuses like “Oh I’ve been too busy, <br />
Been writing codes and battling school, juggling things ain’t easy” <br />
But the truth of the matter is I’ve been burnt out for the longest time, <br />
And the stuff I’ve put out these past few months have been nothing but subpar.

    </p>,
    <p>
        Am I a shadow of myself? <br />
Have I regressed so badly, I can’t string together a sentence? <br />
Been putting off writing so much my drafts seem more like a life sentence <br />
Than the ramblings of an educated youth, nothing in there makes sense.

    </p>,
    <p>
         Did I take a break from writing to focus on other things, <br />
Or did I just not write anything and then did that repeatedly, <br />
I ask myself these questions but even I do not know, <br />
But one thing I do know, my writing has been put on hold.

    </p>,
    <p>
        So here I am trying to come back into the scene with a bang, <br />
Been gone for so long, I might as well be a new man, <br />
My mind feels refreshed ready to give this another chance, <br />
Who would’ve thought a break from all this was the spark I needed
